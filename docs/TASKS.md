Scope:
- Run backend pytest suite and confirm all tests pass
- Start uvicorn backend and confirm no startup errors
- Start Electron desktop with npm start and confirm window opens
- Smoke-check all three gate combinations:
  - flag false + toggle on  → no injection, no audit row
  - flag true  + toggle off → no injection, no audit row
  - flag true  + toggle on  → injection path used, audit row created
- Confirm /chat response does not expose memory content in all cases
- Confirm MemoryInjectionAudit row contents are correct
- Record results in TASKS.md
- Do not modify backend code
- Do not modify Electron UI
- Do not add new features

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-023 is marked DONE ✅
- Backend pytest: 193 passed ✅
- Backend uvicorn starts without errors ✅
- Electron window opens via npm start ✅
- flag false + toggle on: POST /chat 200, no audit row, no memory content in response ✅
- flag true  + toggle off: POST /chat 200, no audit row, no memory content in response ✅
- flag true  + toggle on:  POST /chat 200, audit row created, memory content not in response ✅
- MemoryInjectionAudit row contents verified ✅
- Backend errors: none ✅
- No code changes made ✅

## TASK-025 - Memory Injection Audit Inspection Design

Status: DONE

Goal:
Design how users and developers can inspect memory injection audit records without exposing raw memory content.

Scope:
- Define audit inspection API design
- Define audit inspection UI design
- Define safe display fields
- Define fields that must not be displayed
- Define pagination behavior
- Define relation to no-hidden-memory principle
- Do not implement endpoint
- Do not implement UI
- Do not modify runtime behavior

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-025 is marked DONE ✅
- docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md documents audit inspection rules ✅
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md documents future audit inspection API and UI flow ✅
- docs/ROADMAP.md includes TASK-026 and TASK-027 ✅
- README notes audit inspection is designed but not implemented ✅
- No backend/app code is modified ✅
- No apps/desktop code is modified ✅
- /chat behavior remains unchanged ✅

Design Decisions:
- Future read-only endpoint: GET /memory/audit with limit/offset pagination
- Future Memory UI: Audit Inspection section showing metadata cards
- Safe to display: id, created_at, conversation_id, selected_memory_ids_json, selected_count, total_context_chars, feature_flag_enabled, exclusion_summary_json
- Must NOT display: raw memory content, full prompt text, approved memory context text, system prompt, raw LLM messages
- selected_memory_ids_json shows IDs only — no automatic inline expansion of content
- Audit rows are read-only; GET /memory/audit must not create rows or modify last_used_at
- Default limit: 20, max limit: 100, sort: created_at descending

## TASK-038 - Manual Live LLM Provider Smoke Check

Status: IN_PROGRESS

Goal:
Manually verify the real provider adapter with one live minimal request after explicit user opt-in and cost acknowledgement.

Scope:

- Confirm user has a valid API key
- Confirm user accepts cost risk
- Set backend env vars manually
- Run one minimal provider adapter request
- Verify response normalizes into LLMResponse
- Verify no API key appears in logs / stdout / stderr
- Verify no memory is used
- Verify no /chat wiring is changed
- Clear env vars after test
- Do not add live API calls to automated tests

Acceptance Criteria:

- TASK-038 is recorded as IN_PROGRESS
- User explicitly confirms cost risk before live call
- Live call is manual only
- Automated pytest remains mocked-only
- API key is set only in local backend shell env
- API key is not committed
- Provider returns a non-empty response or safe error
- No API key appears in visible output
- No memory context is sent
- /chat remains not wired to real provider
- Electron UI is not modified
- Env vars are cleared after test

Manual Smoke Checklist:

1. User explicitly confirms:
   - I have an Anthropic API key
   - I understand this may cost money
   - I want to run exactly one minimal live request
2. Set env vars in backend PowerShell:
   - `LLM_PROVIDER_ENABLED=true`
   - `LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=anthropic`
   - `LLM_API_KEY=<real key, not committed>`
   - `LLM_MODEL=<chosen Claude model>`
   - `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30`
   - `LLM_FALLBACK_TO_MOCK=true`
3. Run provider adapter only, not `/chat`.
4. Confirm:
   - response text non-empty OR safe fallback returned
   - no API key printed
   - no raw provider body printed
   - no memory context used
   - no DB/audit row created by this adapter-only smoke
5. Clear env vars after test.

Run Boundary:

- Do not create a permanent script unless absolutely necessary
- Temporary commands must not print API key
- Do not commit local keys
- Do not add keys to `.env.example`
- If the user does not confirm key availability and cost risk, stop before the live call

- Document UI sections: provider selector, API key input, model selection, safety toggles, cost warning, usage meter placement, test connection
- Document settings flow (step-by-step interaction)
- Document security boundaries for settings UI
- Document error UX (7 error types, safe text only)
- Document memory interaction note
- Document non-goals
- Document future implementation sequence (TASK-048 through TASK-052)
- Update docs/BYOK_PRODUCT_AND_SETTINGS.md: note that Provider Settings UI design now exists separately; UI must be backend-mediated; usage meter visible near provider settings
- Update docs/USAGE_METER_DESIGN.md: note Provider Settings UI should include usage meter summary; provider dashboard is billing source of truth
- Update docs/ROADMAP.md: TASK-047 IN_PROGRESS (was Pending), verify TASK-046 DONE

- UI design key decisions:
  - Settings UI must never directly call provider from frontend — all operations backend-mediated
  - API key write-once from UI perspective: never retrieved, never shown after save
  - Test Connection requires explicit user action and confirmation dialog — never automatic, no retries
  - Usage meter summary embedded in Provider Settings panel (primary placement per TASK-046 Section 6.3)
  - Cost warning is non-dismissable when real provider is selected
  - Safety toggles (LLM flags) are read-only status displays in Phase 4 — not interactive
  - 7 error types handled with safe user-facing text only — no HTTP codes, no raw error bodies
- No backend/app was modified
- No apps/desktop was modified
- No tests were added
- No APIs were added

## TASK-049 - Secure Key Storage Design

Status: DONE

Goal:
Design secure local API key storage for future BYOK provider settings. Compare storage options, define the recommended MVP path, define the future desktop path, and document key lifecycle, redaction rules, and API dependency constraints. No runtime code is written.

Scope:
- Compare key storage options (env var, OS keychain, encrypted file, plain SQLite)
- Define recommended MVP storage path
- Define future desktop secure storage path
- Define deletion / rotation behavior
- Define logging and redaction requirements
- Define API dependency constraints
- Define implementation sequence
- Do not implement runtime code
- Do not read API keys
- Do not call external APIs

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-048 is marked DONE ✅
- TASK-049 is recorded as DONE ✅
- docs/SECURE_KEY_STORAGE_DESIGN.md exists ✅
- Storage options are compared (4 options: env var, OS keychain, encrypted file, plain SQLite) ✅
- MVP recommendation is documented (Environment Variable Only for dev phase) ✅
- Future desktop recommendation is documented (OS Keychain / Credential Manager) ✅
- Deletion and rotation behavior are documented (key lifecycle: add, replace, clear, test, rotate, uninstall, debug export) ✅

- Provider Settings API dependency is documented (POST /provider/settings/key blocked until TASK-053) ✅
- No backend/app code is modified ✅
- No apps/desktop code is modified ✅
- No external API call is made ✅

Completion Notes:
- This was a design-only task. No runtime code was written or modified.
- docs/SECURE_KEY_STORAGE_DESIGN.md created: 14 sections covering storage options, recommendation, MVP strategy, key lifecycle, API integration rules, key status model, redaction rules, testing requirements, threat model, and future implementation sequence.
- Dev phase storage recommendation: Environment Variable Only (Option A). No persistent key storage. Key set via shell env before backend start.
- Future production desktop recommendation: OS Keychain / Credential Manager (Option B). Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux libsecret. Implemented via Python keyring library.
- Explicitly forbidden: Plain SQLite / plain config file for real API keys — unacceptable leakage risk via backups, screenshots, debug exports.
- Key lifecycle defined: Add → Replace (overwrites old secret) → Clear (idempotent) → Test (explicit_cost_ack required) → Rotate (same as Replace in Phase 4) → App Uninstall (OS keychain entries not auto-removed; user must be informed) → Debug Export (must exclude key-adjacent fields).
- Threat model documented: accidental git commit, log exposure, frontend renderer exposure, local DB leakage, debug export leakage, malicious local user, malware, OS account compromise. Local malware and OS account compromise are accepted residual risks at the app layer.
- Adjusted implementation sequence: TASK-053 (Secure Key Storage Implementation) must precede TASK-051 (Backend Provider Settings API Implementation).
- No backend/app was modified
- No apps/desktop was modified
- No tests were added
- No APIs were added
- No external API was called

## TASK-054 - Provider Settings Key Endpoint Implementation

Status: DONE

Goal:
Implement safe API key save and clear endpoints through the key storage abstraction without exposing keys or calling providers.

Scope:
- Enable POST /provider/settings/key through key storage service
- Enable DELETE /provider/settings/key through key storage service
- Keep POST /provider/settings/test disabled / placeholder
- Use fake/in-memory backend in tests only
- Runtime unavailable storage must fail safely

- Runtime default storage is still `UnavailableKeyStorageBackend`; save/clear return a safe unavailable error without exposing submitted key values.
- Tests use `InMemoryKeyStorageBackend` only and verify save, clear, idempotent clear, and replace behavior.
- `GET /provider/settings` returns only safe `key_status`; it never returns full or partial key values.
- `POST /provider/settings/test` remains disabled as a safe `501 not_implemented` placeholder.
- API keys are not written to SQLite, logs, stdout, stderr, memory, audit rows, usage records, chat history, or frontend responses.
- No external provider call is made.
- Electron UI is not modified.

## TASK-055 - Provider Settings Key UI Enablement Design

Status: DONE

Goal:
Design how the Provider Settings UI will safely enable the Save Key and Clear Key controls now that the backend key save/clear endpoints are wired to the key storage abstraction (TASK-054). This task is design-only — no runtime code is written, no Electron UI is modified.

Scope:
- Design Save Key UI interaction (password masking, POST to local backend, field clearing after save, disabled states)
- Design Clear Key UI interaction (confirmation dialog, DELETE to local backend, idempotent behavior)
- Design unavailable storage UX (503 → safe message, keep Save disabled, env var dev mode recommendation)
- Design key status display (6 safe values, no key fragments)
- Design Test Connection disabled state (no live calls, future explicit_cost_ack)
- Define security boundaries for key UI (no key in renderer logs, localStorage, screenshots, etc.)
- Define error UX (7 safe messages)
- Define future task sequence (TASK-056 implementation, TASK-057 smoke check, TASK-058 test connection design)
- Do not modify backend/app
- Do not modify apps/desktop
- Do not add tests
- Do not add APIs
- Do not implement UI enablement
- Do not enable Test Connection
- Do not call external APIs
- Do not read real API keys
- Do not modify /chat
- Only modify docs / README

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-054 is marked DONE ✅
- TASK-055 is recorded as DONE ✅
- docs/PROVIDER_SETTINGS_KEY_UI_ENABLEMENT_DESIGN.md exists ✅
- Save Key UI design is documented (masking, POST flow, field clearing, disabled states) ✅
- Clear Key UI design is documented (confirmation, DELETE flow, idempotency) ✅
- Unavailable storage UX is documented (503 safe message, Save disabled, env var recommendation) ✅
- Key status display is documented (6 values, no key fragments) ✅
- Test Connection remains documented as disabled ✅
- Security boundaries are documented (key not in renderer logs / localStorage / screenshots / memory / audit / usage / chat history) ✅
- Error UX is documented (7 safe messages) ✅
- Future task sequence is documented (TASK-056 → TASK-057 → TASK-058 → TASK-059) ✅
- No backend/app code is modified ✅
- No apps/desktop code is modified ✅
- No tests are added ✅
- No APIs are added ✅
- No external API call is made ✅

Completion Notes:
- TASK-055 was a design-only task. No runtime code was written or modified.
- docs/PROVIDER_SETTINGS_KEY_UI_ENABLEMENT_DESIGN.md created: 12 sections covering current state after TASK-054, Save Key UI interaction flow, Clear Key UI interaction flow, unavailable storage UX (503 → safe message + env var recommendation), key status display (6 canonical values), Test Connection disabled state, security boundaries (12 rules), error UX (7 safe messages), non-goals (14 items), future implementation sequence, and relationship to existing documents.
- Save Key UI: password-masked input, POST to local backend only, field cleared after save (success or failure), disabled for mock provider, disabled when storage is unavailable after 503, cost warning shown on real provider selection.
- Clear Key UI: visible only when key exists (any status other than not_configured), requires confirmation dialog before DELETE, idempotent (404 treated as success), never displays key value.
- Unavailable storage UX: 503 response returns safe message with env var setup instructions, no auto-retry, button re-enabled for manual retry.
- Key status display: not_configured / configured / not_tested / invalid / test_success / test_failed mapped to human-readable labels; no key value or fragment in any label.
- Test Connection: remains disabled, button shows "not yet available", deferred to TASK-058 (design) and TASK-059 (implementation).
- Security boundaries: 12 rules — no key in renderer state / IPC / logs / localStorage / screenshots / DevTools / memory audit / usage records / chat history / crash reports; local backend only; no external provider URLs in renderer.
- Error UX: 7 safe messages for storage unavailable (503), invalid provider (400), empty key (400), backend unreachable, save failed (500), clear failed (500), key not found on delete (treated as success).
- No backend/app code was modified.
- No apps/desktop code was modified.
- No tests were added.
- No APIs were added.
- No external API call was made.
- pytest count remains 449 passed (unchanged — design-only task).

---

## TASK-059 - Provider Test Connection Implementation

Status: DONE

Goal:
Implement the backend Test Connection flow as designed in TASK-058, using mocked-provider tests only. No live provider calls.

Scope:
- Implement POST /provider/settings/test endpoint (replace 501 placeholder)
- Require explicit_cost_ack: true in request body; return safe 400 cost_ack_required if missing/false
- Send exactly-one minimal provider-runner request (minimal prompt, low max_tokens, timeout enforced)
- No retries, no streaming, no tools, no memory, no history
- Return safe response model: status / provider / model / source / safe_message / error_category / usage_estimate
- Implement no-fallback policy: test must not silently fall back to mock
- Wire usage meter to record test connection token usage
- Implement redaction rules: no API key / raw provider body / headers / prompt in any log or response
- Write mocked tests only — no live provider calls in pytest
- Keep Electron Test Connection button disabled in this task; UI enablement is deferred
- Do not modify /chat response schema
- Do not add retries or streaming
- Do not call external APIs from tests

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-059 is recorded as DONE ✅
- POST /provider/settings/test is implemented (no longer returns 501) ✅
- explicit_cost_ack: true is required; missing/false returns 400 cost_ack_required ✅
- exactly-one minimal request rule is enforced in backend ✅
- safe response model is returned (status / provider / model / source / safe_message / error_category / usage_estimate) ✅
- no mock fallback on test failure ✅
- usage meter records test connection usage ✅
- redaction rules are enforced in backend ✅
- mocked pytest tests cover: missing cost_ack, false cost_ack, mock provider rejection, missing key, storage unavailable, success, auth failure, timeout, opaque non-2xx body, no retries, no memory/history/tools/streaming, key leakage, usage meter, no memory audit, /chat compatibility, and no external HTTP ✅
- no live external API call in any test ✅
- pytest passes (no regressions) ✅
- No Electron UI changes are made ✅
- No /chat response schema change ✅

Completion Notes:
- TASK-059 was a backend implementation task. No Electron UI was modified. Test Connection button remains disabled in the renderer.
- backend/app/services/provider_test_connection_service.py created: implements the provider test runner abstraction and minimal LLMRequest construction.
- backend/tests/test_provider_test_connection.py created: mocked tests only — uses injectable fake provider runner; no live external API call; no real API key used.
- POST /provider/settings/test implemented (replaces 501 placeholder). Requires explicit_cost_ack: true; missing or false returns safe HTTP 400 cost_ack_required.
- Exactly one minimal LLMRequest per test call: prompt "Reply with OK.", max_tokens=16, no memory context, no state context, no conversation history, no tools, no streaming, no retries.
- Fallback policy: no silent mock fallback. Failures return status=failed, source=llm_real_error, safe error_category only.
- Usage meter records safe aggregate metadata only (provider / model / source / token estimates / error_category). No API key, raw provider body, headers, prompt, or diagnostics in any log or response.
- Runtime default does not call external providers. Tests use injectable fake runner.
- No backend/app code was broken. No apps/desktop code was modified.
- No external API call was made. No real API key was used.

- runtime default runner is UnavailableProviderTestRunner — no external provider calls in default configuration. ✅
- automated tests have no live external API calls. ✅
- Backend surface is safe to expose to UI. TASK-060 may proceed.

Recommended Non-Blocking Hardening Tests (deferred — not blocking TASK-060):
- provider_disabled branch with configured key: verify behavior when LLM_PROVIDER_ENABLED=false but key is configured.
- invalid_model branch: verify safe error_category returned for unsupported model identifier.
- unknown provider error collapses to provider_error: verify unrecognized runner exceptions map to safe category, not raw message.
- suspicious extra field rejection: verify extra request fields (e.g., system_prompt) are rejected without being echoed back.
- safe_message category sweep: verify all error_category values produce distinct, safe, non-technical safe_message strings.

Completion Notes:
- TASK-059R was a safety review task. No runtime code was written or modified.
- No backend/app code was modified.
- No apps/desktop code was modified.
- No tests were added.
- No external API call was made.

## TASK-060 - Provider Test Connection UI Enablement

Status: DONE

Goal:
Enable the Test Connection button in the Electron renderer and wire it to the POST /provider/settings/test backend endpoint, with explicit cost acknowledgement dialog. Blocked until TASK-059R passes.

Scope:
- Enable Test Connection button in Electron renderer for real providers with key_status configured
- Implement explicit cost acknowledgement confirmation dialog before sending request
- Wire renderer to POST /provider/settings/test with explicit_cost_ack: true
- Display safe_message from backend response
- Handle backend error responses (400 cost_ack_required, 503 storage unavailable, 500, network error)
- Key status indicator updated after test (test_success / test_failed)
- No live external API call from renderer — only calls local backend
- No API key exposed in UI or logs
- Do not modify /chat response schema
- Do not add retries

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-060 is recorded as DONE ✅
- Test Connection button enabled for real providers with configured key ✅

- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: added providerTestMsg DOM ref; added isTestingConnection state flag (prevents concurrent requests); added currentProviderSettings cache (set by renderProviderSettings on every load); updated updateKeyUIState() to enable Test Connection when provider !== mock AND key exists AND real_provider_enabled === true AND no in-flight request; updated button title text to explain disabled state; added setProviderTestMsg() helper; added runTestConnection() with explicit window.confirm() cost acknowledgement (all 4 required text items), POST to local backend only with body {provider, model, explicit_cost_ack: true} (no api_key/prompt/memory), safe response rendering (status/safe_message/error_category/source/usage_estimate only); added testProviderConnectionBtn event listener.
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css: added .provider-test-msg and .provider-test-msg.error styles.
- No api_key, prompt, memory_context, or conversation_history sent to test endpoint. ✅
- No automatic test after Save Key. ✅
- No external provider URL in renderer (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, etc.). ✅
- localStorage/sessionStorage references in renderer are comments only, not code. ✅
- Safety scan: no external URL, no localStorage/sessionStorage code, no console.log of key. ✅
- node --check: main.js PASS, renderer.js PASS. ✅
- pytest result: 465 passed (NTFS stale-cache regressions fixed in rsync copy during test run; no backend logic was modified). ✅
- No live external API call was made. ✅
- /chat response schema remains reply / mood / source. ✅
- Runtime smoke check is deferred to TASK-061.

Next Task:
TASK-061 - Provider Test Connection Runtime Smoke Check

---

## TASK-061 - Provider Test Connection Runtime Smoke Check

Status: DONE

Goal:
Perform a manual runtime smoke check of the Test Connection UI flow on the local dev machine. Blocked until TASK-060 is complete.

Scope:
- Start backend and Electron desktop
- Verify Test Connection button disabled for mock provider
- Verify Test Connection button disabled when key_status is not_configured
- Verify Test Connection button enabled for real provider with configured key
- Verify cost acknowledgement dialog appears on click
- Verify cancelling dialog sends no backend request
- Verify confirming dialog sends POST /provider/settings/test
- Verify safe_message displayed in UI
- Verify key status indicator updated after test
- Verify no API key in renderer DevTools or console
- Verify /chat remains functional throughout
- Do not modify backend/app
- Do not modify apps/desktop
- Do not add tests
- Do not call external APIs from automation

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-061 is recorded as DONE ✅
- All smoke check items verified ✅ or recorded as non-blocking / not applicable ✅
- Runtime Smoke Verdict recorded ✅
- No API key leaked in renderer logs or DevTools ✅
- /chat unaffected ✅
- No backend/app code modified ✅
- No apps/desktop code modified ✅
- No external API call made ✅

Smoke Check Results:

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| pytest: 465 passed | ✅ |
| backend start | ✅ pass |
| desktop start | ✅ pass |
| Provider Settings visible | ✅ yes |
| Test Connection button visible | ✅ yes |
| Test Connection disabled when provider is mock | ✅ yes |
| Test Connection disabled when key_status is not_configured | ✅ yes |
| Test Connection enabled when provider real + key_status configured + real_provider_enabled | not directly verified — key_status remained not_configured (expected limitation) |
| Cost acknowledgement dialog shown every click | n/a — Test Connection disabled due to key_status not_configured |
| Cancel cost ack sends no request | n/a |
| Confirm sends POST /provider/settings/test to local backend only | n/a |
| Request body contains provider/model/explicit_cost_ack only | n/a |
| No api_key in request body | n/a |
| Safe message shown in UI | n/a |
| No raw provider body shown | ✅ yes — no provider test request was sent |
| No external provider called | ✅ yes |
| API key not shown / logged / stored | ✅ yes |
| /chat still works | ✅ yes |

Expected Limitation:
- Runtime key storage is unavailable (UnavailableKeyStorageBackend is the default).
- key_status remained not_configured throughout the smoke check.
- Test Connection button stayed disabled — this is the correct and safe behavior.
- Full click-through Test Connection flow requires a test harness or configured secure key storage.
- A real API key was NOT used to force the smoke; this is intentional per TASK-060 safety constraints.

Known Non-Blocking UI Issues (deferred):
- Electron UI font/layout is difficult to read in some window sizes.
- DevTools docked to the side can squeeze the layout.
- Recommended future task: UI polish/layout hardening.

Runtime Smoke Verdict: PASS WITH EXPECTED LIMITATION

Completion Notes:
- TASK-061 was a runtime smoke check task. No code was written or modified.
- No backend/app code was modified.
- No apps/desktop code was modified.
- No tests were added.
- No external API call was made.
- No real API key was used.

TASK-062 - Provider Test Connection Hardening Tests

---

## TASK-062 - Provider Test Connection Hardening Tests

Status: DONE

Goal:
Implement the non-blocking hardening tests recommended by Opus safety review (TASK-059R) for the POST /provider/settings/test endpoint. Covers edge cases not included in the initial TASK-059 mocked test suite.

Scope:
- provider_disabled branch with configured key: verify behavior when LLM_PROVIDER_ENABLED=false but key is configured
- invalid_model branch: verify safe error_category returned for unsupported model identifier
- unknown provider error collapses to provider_error: verify unrecognized runner exceptions map to safe category, not raw message
- suspicious extra field rejection: verify extra request fields (e.g., system_prompt) are rejected without being echoed back
- safe_message category sweep: verify all error_category values produce distinct, safe, non-technical safe_message strings
- All tests must use mocked runner — no live provider calls
- No real API key
- Do not modify backend/app behavior (tests only)
- Do not modify apps/desktop
- Do not add new backend API endpoints
- Do not call external APIs

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-062 is recorded as DONE
- All 5 Opus-recommended hardening test cases implemented ✅
- All tests pass (no regressions) ✅
- All tests use mocked runner — no live external API call ✅
- No real API key used ✅
- No backend logic modified ✅
- No apps/desktop code modified ✅
- pytest passes (no regressions) ✅

Implementation Summary:
- Added 5 hardening tests to backend/tests/test_provider_test_connection.py (lines 372-536)
- Test A: provider_disabled branch — verifies runner not called when real_provider_enabled=False, even with configured key
- Test B: invalid_model branch — verifies 400 invalid_model returned before runner call when no model in request or settings
- Test C: unknown error collapse — verifies unrecognized runner error strings map to safe 'provider_error', raw string does not leak
- Test D: extra field rejection — verifies ConfigDict extra='forbid' rejects system_prompt injection, sentinel value not echoed, runner not called
- Test E: safe_message category sweep — verifies all 11 error categories have non-empty safe messages free of API key / raw body / prompt sentinels
- pytest: 470 passed (465 pre-existing + 5 new), 0 failed, 0 regressions
- No backend/app logic modified, no apps/desktop code modified, no external API calls

- Electron static checks pass

Implementation Summary:
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css: increased base font size and line height, section padding, form spacing, button/input sizing, helper text sizing, and Provider Settings status/usage layout readability.
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css: removed global fixed-height/hidden-overflow behavior, allowed body/html vertical scrolling, converted Provider/Memory/Audit sections away from nested fixed section scrolling, and added page bottom padding.
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css: improved Provider Settings form grid, key actions wrapping, status cards, usage summary block, long-text wrapping, and narrow-width media queries for DevTools docked right.
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html: updated stale Test Connection helper copy and replaced small inline status text with a CSS class.
- Save Key / Clear Key / Test Connection endpoint calls, enable conditions, explicit_cost_ack confirm logic, safe response rendering, usage data, /chat payload, and backend behavior were not changed.
- No backend/app code was modified.
- No backend tests were modified.
- No external API call was made.

Validation:
- Safety scan: renderer contains no api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, platform.claude.com, direct provider frontend call, API key console logging, or API key localStorage/sessionStorage storage.
- `node --check src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- pytest not run because backend/app and backend tests were not modified.

Next Task:
TASK-064 - Provider Settings UI Runtime Smoke Re-check

---

## TASK-064 - Provider Settings UI Runtime Smoke Re-check

Status: DONE

Goal:
Re-check the Electron Provider Settings UI at runtime after TASK-063 readability and layout polish, without changing backend/app, renderer code, tests, APIs, or provider behavior.

Scope:
- Start local backend
- Start Electron desktop
- Re-check Provider Settings readability and scroll behavior
- Re-check narrow layout / DevTools docked-right usability
- Confirm Save Key / Clear Key / Test Connection behavior remains unchanged
- Confirm Test Connection remains local-backend-only
- Confirm no external provider is called
- Confirm no real API key is used
- Confirm /chat still works
- Do not modify backend/app
- Do not modify apps/desktop
- Do not add tests
- Do not add APIs
- Do not call a live external provider

Smoke Check Results:

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| backend start | pass |
| desktop start | pass |
| Electron UI readable after TASK-063 | yes |
| Page can scroll vertically | yes |
| Provider Settings section fully visible | yes |
| Provider Settings fields readable | yes |
| Usage summary readable | yes |
| Buttons wrap / remain usable in narrow layout | yes |
| DevTools docked right no longer blocks basic operation | partially |
| Save Key behavior unchanged | yes |
| Clear Key behavior unchanged | yes |
| Test Connection behavior unchanged | yes |
| Test Connection remains local-backend-only | yes |
| No external provider called | yes |
| API key not shown/logged/stored | yes |
| /chat still works | yes |

Validation Notes:
- Known TASK-063 static checks remain valid: `node --check src/main.js` PASS; `node --check src/renderer/renderer.js` PASS.
- Backend runtime smoke used local backend only: `GET /health` returned `status=ok`; `POST /chat` returned a mock response with `source=mock`.
- Desktop runtime start passed after clearing the local shell environment variable `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`; the first attempt failed because that environment variable made Electron run in Node mode.
- DevTools docked-right result is recorded as partially because the narrow-layout behavior is improved and basic controls remain usable, but a full manual docked DevTools click-through with saved key storage was not performed.
- No real API key was entered.
- No Save Key, Clear Key, or Test Connection endpoint behavior was changed.
- No Test Connection request was sent to a live provider.
- No external provider API was called.
- No backend/app code was modified.
- No apps/desktop code was modified.
- No tests were added.
- pytest was not run because this task did not modify backend/app or backend tests.

- docs/OLLAMA_PROVIDER_DESIGN.md: created — covers purpose, local model test results (qwen3:8b recommended, gemma3:12b slower), Ollama API contract (POST /api/chat, response mapping), provider settings integration (key disabled for ollama, key_status=not_required), feature flags (6 env vars), Test Connection behavior (local resource warning, 5 error categories), /chat behavior (source=llm_local, schema unchanged), usage meter integration, security boundaries (no external URL in renderer, no prompt logging), and implementation sequence (TASK-073 → TASK-077)
- docs/ROADMAP.md: Local Ollama Provider track added
- README.md: local Ollama provider design note added

TASK-073 - Ollama Provider Implementation Behind Feature Flag

---

## TASK-073 - Ollama Provider Implementation Behind Feature Flag

Status: DONE

Goal:
Implement OllamaLocalProvider behind existing LLM provider feature flags without changing /chat schema or Electron UI.

Scope:
- Add Ollama config helpers to backend/app/core/config.py
- Create backend/app/llm/ollama_provider.py (OllamaLocalProvider)
- Update backend/app/llm/factory.py to resolve provider=ollama without API key
- Add backend/tests/test_llm_ollama_provider.py (19 mocked-HTTP tests)
- No Electron UI changes
- No /chat schema changes
- No external provider calls
- No API key required

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-073 is recorded as DONE ✅
- OllamaLocalProvider exists ✅
- Factory resolves provider=ollama when enabled ✅
- Ollama provider calls localhost only ✅
- Ollama provider requires no API key ✅
- Request body includes model, messages, stream=false, think=false, keep_alive, options ✅
- Response parses message.content ✅
- Usage fields (eval_count, prompt_eval_count) mapped safely ✅
- Errors map to safe categories (ollama_unavailable, provider_timeout, model_not_found, invalid_response, provider_error) ✅
- No retries ✅
- No streaming ✅
- No tools ✅
- /chat schema remains reply/mood/source ✅
- Electron UI unchanged ✅
- pytest: 489 passed ✅
- No live external API call in tests ✅

Implementation Summary:
- backend/app/core/config.py: added get_ollama_base_url() (localhost-only validation — non-localhost URL silently returns safe default), get_ollama_keep_alive() (default 10m), get_ollama_timeout_seconds() (default 30, clamped 1–120)
- backend/app/llm/ollama_provider.py: created — OllamaLocalProvider implements LLMProvider Protocol; injectable HTTPJSONClient; POST {base_url}/api/chat; no API key; maps message.content to LLMResponse.text; maps eval_count → output_tokens_actual, prompt_eval_count → input_tokens_actual; 5 error categories (ollama_unavailable, provider_timeout, model_not_found, invalid_response, provider_error); __repr__/__str__ safe (no secrets, no prompt text, no response body)
- backend/app/llm/factory.py: added SUPPORTED_LOCAL_PROVIDERS = {"ollama"} separate from SUPPORTED_REAL_PROVIDERS; Ollama path bypasses API key check entirely in get_resolved_llm_provider_info(); get_llm_provider() returns OllamaLocalProvider() when provider_name="ollama" and LLM_PROVIDER_ENABLED=true; unknown provider behavior unchanged
- backend/tests/test_llm_ollama_provider.py: 19 mocked-HTTP tests — success mapping, usage fields, missing eval counts → usage=None, connection refused, httpx.ConnectError, timeout, HTTP 404, HTTP 500, missing message key, empty content, message not dict, response not dict, factory resolves ollama without key, factory unknown provider fallback, resolved info skips key check for ollama, factory disabled returns mock, repr safety, provider_name, payload structure (stream/think/messages order)

Completion Notes:
- No live Ollama server required for any test — all 19 tests use injectable FakeHTTPClient or RaisingHTTPClient
- NTFS stale cache workaround applied: rsync to /tmp/, verify with ast.parse(), pytest from /tmp/ — standard project workaround
- ollama_provider.py imports HTTPJSONClient Protocol and HTTPXJSONClient from real_provider.py — no duplication
- renderer never calls Ollama directly — backend-only architecture boundary preserved
- /chat response schema (reply / mood / source) unchanged
- Electron UI unchanged
- No API key used or stored

## TASK-074 - Ollama Provider Contract Tests and Runtime Smoke Prep

Status: DONE

Goal:
Strengthen Ollama provider contract tests and prepare a safe runtime smoke checklist without running live Ollama smoke.

Scope:
- Add or strengthen mocked Ollama provider contract tests
- Verify localhost-only base URL behavior
- Verify request body schema
- Verify no API key / no tools / no streaming
- Verify safe error mapping
- Verify no raw body leakage
- Verify no retries
- Prepare runtime smoke checklist for TASK-075
- Do not modify Electron UI
- Do not run live Ollama smoke in this task

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-074 is recorded as DONE
- Ollama contract tests cover request schema
- localhost-only behavior is covered
- no-key behavior is covered
- safe error mapping is covered
- raw body opacity is covered
- no-retry behavior is covered
- runtime smoke checklist is documented
- pytest passes
- Electron UI is unchanged
- no external API call occurs
- no API key is used

Implementation Summary:
- backend/app/llm/ollama_provider.py: usage mapping now includes safe aggregate Ollama duration metadata (`total_duration`, `eval_duration`) in addition to token counts.
- backend/tests/test_llm_ollama_provider.py: strengthened mocked contract coverage from 19 to 34 tests.
- Added full request schema coverage: `model`, `stream=false`, `think=false`, `keep_alive`, `options.temperature`, `options.num_predict`, and ordered `messages`.
- Added negative payload coverage: no `api_key`, `key`, `tools`, `memory_context`, `conversation_history`, or `stream=true`.
- Added system/user message order coverage and confirmed raw memory/history fields are not passed as top-level Ollama payload fields.
- Added localhost-only config/factory coverage: default localhost, `localhost:11434` allowed, `127.0.0.1:11434` allowed, non-local URL falls back to safe default and is not passed to provider.
- Added no-key coverage: `LLM_API_KEY` unset still resolves `provider=ollama`; if `LLM_API_KEY` is set, it is not sent in request body or headers.
- Added response usage mapping coverage for `prompt_eval_count`, `eval_count`, `total_duration`, and `eval_duration`, with raw provider fields kept out of usage.
- Added additional safe error coverage for malformed JSON, missing `message.content`, empty text, non-2xx generic errors, and unknown exceptions.
- Added raw body opacity coverage with `RAW_PROVIDER_BODY_SHOULD_NOT_LEAK`, `SECRET_SENTINEL`, and `PROMPT_SENTINEL`.
- Added no-retry coverage: fake HTTP client call count is exactly 1 on success and failure.
- Added `/chat` response schema guard for `reply / mood / source`.
- docs/OLLAMA_RUNTIME_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md created for TASK-075.
- No apps/desktop files modified; Electron UI unchanged.
- No live Ollama runtime smoke executed in this task.
- No external provider call made.
- No API key used.

Validation:
- Targeted Ollama tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_llm_ollama_provider.py` -> 34 passed.
- Full backend pytest: `python -m pytest` -> 504 passed.

Next Task:
TASK-075 - Ollama Runtime Smoke Check

## TASK-075F - Ollama Chat Source Mapping Fix

Status: DONE

Goal:
Fix /chat source field for Ollama local provider. Runtime smoke (TASK-075) revealed source="llm_real" was returned for successful Ollama responses. Correct values are source="llm_local" on success and source="llm_local_error" on failure.

Root Cause:
_source_for_llm_response() in chat_service.py only branched on MockLLMProvider vs. everything else, defaulting all non-mock providers to "llm_real". OllamaLocalProvider had no special case.

Scope:
- Fix _source_for_llm_response() in backend/app/services/chat_service.py
- Fix _safe_llm_fallback_response() in same file
- Add 5 new tests to backend/tests/test_chat_service.py
- No Electron UI changes
- No /chat schema changes
- No external API calls
- No API key required

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-075F is recorded as DONE ✅
- provider_name="ollama" success → source="llm_local" ✅
- provider_name="ollama" error + fallback disabled → source="llm_local_error" ✅
- provider_name="ollama" error + fallback enabled → source="mock" ✅
- provider_name="anthropic" unchanged → source="llm_real" ✅
- /chat schema still exactly reply/mood/source ✅
- Electron UI unchanged ✅
- No external API call in tests ✅
- pytest: 494 passed ✅

Implementation Summary:
- backend/app/services/chat_service.py: added _LOCAL_PROVIDER_NAMES = frozenset({"ollama"}); updated _source_for_llm_response() to return "llm_local" for local providers; updated _safe_llm_fallback_response() to return "llm_local_error" for local providers; Anthropic/mock behavior unchanged
- backend/tests/test_chat_service.py: added 5 tests — ollama success→llm_local, ollama error+fallback disabled→llm_local_error, ollama error+fallback enabled→mock, anthropic unchanged→llm_real, schema check reply/mood/source only

Next Task:
TASK-075 - Ollama Runtime Smoke Check (re-run)

## TASK-075G - Ollama Persona Prompt Injection Fix

Status: DONE

Goal:
Fix the character persona not being sent to the local LLM. Runtime smoke (TASK-075) showed Ollama responses were in generic assistant tone because _CHARACTER_PROMPTS contained only English placeholder text with no 克莉絲蒂娜 character definition.

Root Cause:
_CHARACTER_PROMPTS in prompt_service.py were written as "structural only" placeholders, explicitly not intended to be sent to an LLM. The prompts had no character name, no pronouns, no language specification, and no personality traits.

Scope:
- Rewrite _CHARACTER_PROMPTS in backend/app/services/prompt_service.py
- All 5 modes now share a _PERSONA_BASE defining 克莉絲蒂娜 identity
- Each mode appends mode-specific behavior instructions
- Update existing test that relied on "project mode" string
- Add 7 new tests in backend/tests/test_prompt_service.py
- No Electron UI changes, no /chat schema changes, no external API calls

Persona defined:
- 名字：克莉絲蒂娜（Christina）
- 身份：傲嬌的遠古龍
- 自稱：吾 / 稱用戶：汝
- 語言：繁體中文
- 個性：表面冷淡自傲，實際關心用戶，嘴硬不承認

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-075G is recorded as DONE ✅
- All 5 mode prompts include 克莉絲蒂娜 ✅
- All 5 mode prompts include 吾 and 汝 ✅
- All 5 mode prompts instruct 繁體中文 ✅
- Casual mode prompt includes 傲嬌 ✅
- Debug mode prompt is accuracy-focused ✅
- End-to-end test confirms system message sent to Ollama contains persona keywords ✅
- Exactly one HTTP call per generate() — no retries ✅
- Electron UI unchanged ✅
- No external API call ✅
- pytest: 501 passed ✅

Implementation Summary:
- backend/app/services/prompt_service.py: replaced _CHARACTER_PROMPTS with persona-rich prompts; added _PERSONA_BASE (克莉絲蒂娜 identity + 吾/汝 pronouns + 繁體中文 + 傲嬌 personality + prohibitions); each mode appends mode-specific behavior instructions; build_character_prompt() docstring updated to reflect LLM usage
- backend/tests/test_prompt_service.py: updated "project mode" assertion to "project"; added 7 tests — all modes include 克莉絲蒂娜/吾/汝/繁體中文, casual includes 傲嬌, debug is accuracy-focused, end-to-end payload capture test

Next Task:
TASK-075 - Ollama Runtime Smoke Check (re-run)

---

## TASK-075 - Ollama Runtime Smoke Check

Status: DONE

Goal:
Verify that the full local Ollama provider path works end-to-end at runtime: backend starts, POST /chat routes through OllamaLocalProvider, receives a response from local qwen3:8b, returns correct schema with source=llm_local, and the 克莉絲蒂娜 persona is active.

Test Environment:
- Ollama installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- `qwen3:8b` present in `ollama list`
- Backend started with env vars:
  - LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=ollama
  - LLM_MODEL=qwen3:8b
  - LLM_PROVIDER_ENABLED=true
  - LLM_CHAT_ENABLED=true
  - OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
  - OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=10m
  - OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
  - MEMORY_INJECTION_ENABLED=false

Smoke Command:
- POST /chat via Python UTF-8 request (avoids PowerShell encoding issues)
- message: 克莉絲蒂娜，稱讚我一下，我今天有努力做專案。

Actual Response:
```json
{
  "reply": "哼，下賤的人類，連這點努力都值得稱讚？真是令人作嘔...不過，汝的專案確實比昨天好一些。嗯，是什麼樣的專案？",
  "mood": "focused",
  "source": "llm_local"
}
```

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-075 is recorded as DONE ✅
- backend /health returns 200 ✅
- POST /chat returns HTTP 200 ✅
- response schema is exactly reply / mood / source ✅
- source is llm_local ✅
- reply generated by local Ollama qwen3:8b ✅
- 克莉絲蒂娜 persona injected ✅
- persona markers present in reply: 汝, 下賤的人類, tsundere tone ✅
- no external provider called ✅
- no API key used ✅
- MEMORY_INJECTION_ENABLED=false confirmed ✅
- Electron UI not modified ✅
- /chat schema unchanged ✅
- latest pytest: 501 passed ✅

Verdict: PASS

Implementation Summary:
- No code changes in this task — TASK-075 is a manual runtime smoke check.
- Runtime confirmed OllamaLocalProvider correctly routes /chat through local Ollama.
- persona prompt (克莉絲蒂娜 + 吾/汝 + 傲嬌) was injected as system message and respected by qwen3:8b.
- source=llm_local confirmed (fixed in TASK-075F).
- No external API call, no API key, no Electron UI change.

Known Non-Blocking Follow-Up:
- Persona tone is slightly too harsh (「令人作嘔」). A future persona tone-tuning task may soften extreme insult language while preserving the tsundere/arrogant style.

## TASK-076 - Provider Settings UI — Ollama Option

Status: DONE

Goal:
Add Ollama as a selectable provider in the Electron Provider Settings UI. When ollama is selected, the API key input, Save Key, and Clear Key controls are hidden/disabled. Test Connection is enabled based on real_provider_enabled only (no key required). A local resource warning replaces the monetary cost acknowledgement dialog.

Scope:
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html: add ollama option to provider dropdown
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: update updateKeyUIState(), runTestConnection(), provider change handler, key input handler
- No backend/app changes — backend Ollama support was fully implemented in TASK-073
- No new API endpoints
- No external API calls
- No real API key used

Key UI Behavior Changes (ollama selected):
- Provider dropdown shows third option: "ollama — local, no key"
- API key input: disabled, placeholder shows "Not required — Ollama runs locally, no API key needed"
- Save Key button: hidden (display:none)
- Clear Key button: hidden (display:none)
- Test Connection: enabled when real_provider_enabled=true (no key check)
- Test Connection dialog: "Local Resource Warning" instead of "Cost Acknowledgement"
  - Message: "This will send a test request to your local Ollama server. This will use your GPU/CPU for inference. No data leaves your device."
- Provider change handler: delegates to updateKeyUIState() with not_required key_status for ollama

Safety Constraints (all preserved):
- Renderer never calls Ollama directly — localhost:11434 not referenced in renderer
- No api_key field in Test Connection request body — unchanged
- explicit_cost_ack: true still sent to backend for all providers including ollama
- No API key console logging
- No API key localStorage/sessionStorage
- No external provider URL in renderer
- Save Key endpoint not called for ollama

Acceptance Criteria:
- TASK-076 is recorded as DONE ✅
- Provider dropdown includes ollama option ✅
- When provider=ollama: API key input disabled with local-provider placeholder ✅
- When provider=ollama: Save Key and Clear Key hidden ✅
- When provider=ollama: Test Connection enabled when real_provider_enabled=true ✅
- When provider=ollama: Test Connection dialog shows local resource warning ✅
- Cloud provider path (anthropic) behavior unchanged ✅
- Mock provider path behavior unchanged ✅
- node --check renderer.js: PASS ✅
- Safety scan: no direct Ollama call, no external URL, no key logging ✅
- No backend/app code modified ✅
- No external API call made ✅
- No real API key used ✅

Implementation Summary:
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html: added <option value="ollama">ollama — local, no key</option>
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: updateKeyUIState() — added isLocalProvider flag; disabled/hidden key controls for ollama; Test Connection canTest logic branches on isLocalProvider; button title text branches on provider type
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: runTestConnection() — added isLocalProvider guard; cloud-only key check before testing; separate window.confirm() dialogs for local vs cloud; request body unchanged (explicit_cost_ack: true always sent)
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: providerApiKeyInput input handler — isLocalProvider check prevents Save Key enable for ollama
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: providerSettingsProvider change handler — rewrote to delegate to updateKeyUIState() with not_required key_status for ollama; clears input and key message on every provider change
- node --check: SYNTAX OK
- Safety scan: no direct Ollama URL in renderer, no external provider URL, no console key logging, no api_key in test request body

Next Task:

## TASK-080 - Electron End-to-End Local Chat Smoke

Status: DONE

Goal:
Verify the Electron desktop UI can configure the Ollama local provider, run Test Connection, send chat through the backend `/chat` endpoint, render the Christina reply, and handle mood/source safely.

Scope:
- Launch backend and Electron locally for smoke validation.
- Configure Provider Settings UI to `provider=ollama`, `model=qwen3:8b`, `real_provider_enabled=true`, `llm_chat_enabled=true`, and `fallback_to_mock=false`.
- Verify Test Connection uses the Local Resource Warning and succeeds with `source=llm_local`.
- Verify chat send calls backend `/chat`.
- Verify assistant reply renders in the UI and mood label updates.
- Verify `source=llm_local` through the fetch log and provider usage summary.
- Add renderer chat smoke coverage with no external test dependency.
- Preserve `/chat` schema.
- Preserve renderer backend-only provider architecture.
- Do not add any direct Ollama URL to renderer code.

Implementation Summary:
- apps/desktop/package.json: added `test:renderer`.
- apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js: added a Node VM renderer smoke test covering send button, Enter handling, `/chat` fetch, reply rendering, `source=llm_local`, mood handling, backend error UI, and renderer safety scan.
- Existing Electron chat wiring was sufficient; no `/chat` schema change was needed.
- Electron E2E local smoke confirmed Provider Settings state: `ollama`, `qwen3:8b`, `not_required`, `real_provider_enabled=true`, `llm_chat_enabled=true`, `fallback_to_mock=false`.
- Test Connection returned: `Local Ollama connection successful. [source: llm_local]`.
- Chat UI POSTed backend `/chat`, rendered a Christina-style reply, and processed `mood=focused`.
- Renderer safety boundary preserved: no direct `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer`.

Validation:
- Electron E2E local chat smoke: PASS.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.

TASK-081 - Local Ollama UX Stabilization / Runtime Follow-up

---

## TASK-081 - Local Ollama UX Stabilization / Runtime Follow-up

Status: DONE

Goal:
Stabilize the Local Ollama runtime UX so users can understand chat source, loading/cold-start state, provider consistency, and safe error states without changing `/chat` schema or renderer provider boundaries.

Scope:
- Show chat response source in the Electron runtime status area.
- Show Provider Settings provider/resolved/model/key/flag state more clearly.
- Add local Ollama loading/cold-start copy while `/chat` is in flight.
- Improve safe renderer error messages for backend offline, provider timeout, local provider failure, and fallback-to-mock states.
- Keep renderer backend-only; do not add direct Ollama URLs.
- Preserve `/chat` response schema: `reply / mood / source`.

Implementation Summary:
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html: added chat runtime source/provider status fields and expanded Provider Settings status rows for provider, model, real provider enabled, LLM chat enabled, and fallback-to-mock.
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css: added runtime status pill styling and widened Provider Settings status grid.
- apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js: added source-aware chat runtime status, local Ollama cold-start loading copy, safer backend-offline detection, safe provider timeout/model/error messages, and explicit fallback/mock source explanations.
- apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js: strengthened renderer smoke coverage for reply render, mood update, visible `source=llm_local`, loading/cold-start state, backend offline, provider timeout, `llm_local_error`, mock fallback, Test Connection success, Provider Settings consistency, Enter send, and renderer safety scan.
- apps/desktop/package.json: existing `test:renderer` script continues to run the strengthened smoke.

Validation:
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- Renderer safety scan for `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, and bare `11434` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF warnings only.

TASK-082 - Local Ollama Release Readiness Review

---

## TASK-082 - Local Ollama Release Readiness Review

Status: DONE

Goal:
Review Local Ollama MVP release readiness and confirm docs, smoke flow, dirty diff state, UI source display strategy, fallback policy, safety boundaries, and tests are aligned for a stable checkpoint.

Review Results:
- Documentation is aligned after small updates to README, backend README, Ollama provider design, TASKS, and ROADMAP.
- Ollama remains local-only and requires no API key.
- Renderer still calls only the backend; it does not call Ollama directly.
- Test Connection uses the backend path and performs a lightweight local runtime/model check. Persona and generation are validated by `/chat`.
- `/chat` schema remains `reply / mood / source`.
- Runtime provider settings affect `/chat`; `resolved_provider`, `llm_chat_enabled`, and `fallback_to_mock` must be read together.
- Source display remains in the main chat runtime status area for MVP smoke/demo clarity.
- Local cold-start UX is documented and visible while `/chat` is pending.
- Dirty diff review found no cache/temp artifacts to commit; root `package-lock.json` remains untracked and intentionally excluded from the previous commit.

Release Smoke Flow:
1. Start `ollama serve`.
2. Confirm `ollama list` includes `qwen3:8b`.
3. Start backend with Ollama provider flags.
4. PATCH `/provider/settings` to `provider=ollama`, `model=qwen3:8b`, `real_provider_enabled=true`, `llm_chat_enabled=true`, and `fallback_to_mock=false`.
5. POST `/provider/settings/test` to verify backend local runtime/model reachability.
6. POST `/chat` to verify generation, persona, `mood`, and `source=llm_local`.
7. Start Electron and run UI Test Connection.
8. Send chat through the UI and confirm reply render, mood update, and `source: llm_local`.

Fallback Policy:
- Development and smoke tests: use `fallback_to_mock=false`.
- Demo mode: `fallback_to_mock=true` is allowed when a mock fallback is preferable to a visible local provider error.
- If `source=mock` while `resolved_provider=ollama`, treat it as chat disabled or fallback behavior, not a successful local Ollama response.
- Turn fallback off when proving local model generation.

Validation:

## TASK-083 - Mood → Pet Expression Mapping

Status: DONE

### Summary

Added inline SVG pet avatar expressions to the Electron desktop UI, wired to the
`mood` field returned by `/chat`. No external images, no Live2D, no direct Ollama
calls from the renderer.

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`**
- Added `<section id="pet-display">` with `<div id="pet-face" data-mood="neutral">` and
  `<p id="pet-display-hint">` between `#character-status` and `<main id="chat-area">`.

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`**
- Added `#pet-display`, `.pet-face`, `.pet-face svg`, `.pet-face[data-mood="pending"]`,
  `.pet-face[data-mood="offline"]`, `.pet-face[data-mood="error"]`, `.pet-display-hint` rules.

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`**
- Added `PET_EXPRESSIONS` map: 10 inline SVG strings for `neutral`, `happy`, `focused`,
  `proud`, `annoyed`, `sleepy`, `worried`, `pending`, `error`, `offline`.
- Added `KNOWN_MOODS = new Set(Object.keys(PET_EXPRESSIONS))` for unknown-mood guard.
- Added `setPetExpression(mood)` — falls back to `neutral` for unknown moods.
- Added `setPetHint(text)`.
- `setMood()` now calls `setPetExpression()` and `setPetHint()`.
- `sendMessage()` sets `pending` before fetch; on success calls `setMood(data.mood)` then
  overrides expression to `error` when `source` is `llm_local_error` / `llm_real_error`;
  catch block sets `offline` on network error, `error` otherwise.
- Startup offline path calls `setPetExpression("offline")`.

**`apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`**
- `FakeElement` extended with `innerHTML`, `setAttribute`, `getAttribute`, `_attributes`.
- `createFetchStub` extended with `unknown_mood` chatMode.
- 8 new test functions added and registered in `main()`:
  1. `testSuccessfulChatWithFocusedMoodSetsFocusedExpression`
  2. `testPendingExpressionSetBeforeResponse`
  3. `testUnknownMoodFallsBackToNeutralExpression`
  4. `testBackendOfflineSetsOfflineExpression`
  5. `testLocalErrorSetsErrorExpression`
  6. `testMockFallbackExpressionFollowsMoodNotSource`
  7. `testSourceStatusRemainsVisibleAlongsidePetExpression`
  8. `testProviderTimeoutSetsErrorExpression`

### Safety invariants maintained

- Renderer does NOT call Ollama directly.
- No `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` in renderer source.
- No external image URLs. No Live2D / Spine / 3D.
- `/chat` schema unchanged.
- API key never logged or stored in localStorage/sessionStorage.

### Verification

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS (18 tests: 10 existing + 8 new).
- Renderer safety scan for `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, bare `11434` in
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed.

## TASK-084 - Christina Visual Asset Pipeline

Status: DONE

### Summary

Established the formal visual asset pipeline for Christina expression PNGs.
No renderer logic was modified. Inline SVG placeholders (TASK-083) remain active for all moods.
No large binaries added beyond the user-provided reference image.

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/reference/christina_v0_reference.png`**
- User-provided. Confirmed: local file, valid PNG, RGBA (colour type 6), 1024×1536 px, 2.1 MB, alpha channel present.

- Documents `christina_v0_reference.png` as the v0 visual baseline.
- Defines mood expression file naming spec: `christina_<mood>.png`.
- Lists all 10 required moods with filenames and descriptions.
- Specifies image requirements: RGBA PNG, transparent background, 512×512 px recommended.
- Documents fallback strategy: SVG placeholder if PNG missing, never broken UI.
- Documents rollout order (neutral → focused → positive → personality → system moods).
- Safety rules: no external URLs, no Ollama calls from renderer, no Live2D.

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/README.md`** (new)
- Placeholder directory marker listing the 10 expected PNG filenames.
- States no expression PNGs present yet; renderer falls back to SVG placeholders.

### Safety invariants maintained

## TASK-085 - Create Christina Neutral Expression PNG

Status: DONE

### Summary

Generated `christina_neutral.png` (512×512 RGBA PNG, 337 KB) from the v0 reference image
using Python Pillow. Renderer behaviour unchanged — inline SVG placeholders remain active.
No renderer, backend, or schema changes.

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_neutral.png`** (new)
- 512×512 RGBA PNG, transparent background, 337 KB.
- Crop: cols 59–982, rows 0–844 (top 55% of 1024×1536 reference) → padded to 924×924 → Lanczos scale to 512×512.
- Face/bust portrait showing horns, face, upper body, and dress collar.

**`apps/desktop/scripts/create-christina-neutral-asset.py`** (new)
- Reproducible one-file script: reads reference, crops, pads, scales, saves.
- Usage: `python apps/desktop/scripts/create-christina-neutral-asset.py`

### Crop strategy

Source crop (59, 0) → (983, 844) = 924×844 px (top 55% of 1536 px height).
Captures: dragon horns tips (rows 0–64, ~4% filled), hair/face (rows 64–256),
upper body/dress (rows 256–512 in output). Padded to 924×924 transparent canvas,
then Lanczos scaled to 512×512. Final fill: 50.9% non-transparent.

## TASK-086 - Renderer Image Asset Fallback

Status: DONE

### Summary

Added image-with-SVG-fallback logic to the Electron renderer's pet expression system.
When a `christina_<mood>.png` asset exists, it is shown via `<img>`; when absent or
load fails, the inline SVG placeholder (TASK-083) remains active. UI never breaks.
22 smoke tests pass (18 pre-existing + 4 new).

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`**
- `setPetExpression(mood)` updated (TASK-086 image-with-SVG-fallback strategy):
  1. Sets inline SVG immediately — no flash while probe runs.
  2. Guards `typeof Image === "undefined"` — no-op in non-browser / test envs.
  3. Probes `assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_${safeMood}.png` via `new Image()`.
  4. `probe.onload`: stale-mood guard (`data-mood !== safeMood` → discard), then replaces
     SVG with `<img style="object-fit:contain">` via `innerHTML=""` + `appendChild`.
  5. `probe.onerror`: SVG placeholder already set — no-op.
  - Safety: `safeMood` is always from `KNOWN_MOODS` set; no user input in asset path.

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`**
- Added `.pet-face img { width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:contain; display:block; }`
  so PNG expressions fill the 80×80 container without cropping horns/head.

**`apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`**
- Added `FakeImageBase` class (base with `onload`, `onerror`, `_src`, `get src()`).
- `loadRenderer` now accepts `options.availableImages` (default `[]`).
  - Constructs per-test `availableImages = new Set(...)`.
  - Defines `class FakeImage extends FakeImageBase` inside `loadRenderer` closing over
    `availableImages` — each test run is fully isolated.
  - `FakeImage.set src(val)`: schedules `onload`/`onerror` via `setTimeout` matching
    real async browser behaviour.
  - Adds `Image: FakeImage` to vm sandbox.
- State extended with `availableImages` field.
- 4 new test functions registered in `main()`:
  1. `testNeutralMoodUsesPngImageWhenAvailable` — neutral PNG available → IMG child, correct src, empty innerHTML.
  2. `testPngLoadFailureFallsBackToSvg` — no PNG → innerHTML has `<svg`, no IMG child.
  3. `testFocusedMoodFallsBackToSvgWhenNoPng` — focused chat, no PNG → SVG fallback.
  4. `testImageAssetDoesNotBreakSourceOrMoodLabel` — PNG available (neutral) then focused chat → source status + mood label correct.

### Key design decisions

- SVG placeholder is always set first (synchronously) before the image probe fires.
  This eliminates any blank-face flash.
- `typeof Image === "undefined"` guard: all pre-TASK-086 tests that do not pass `Image`
  in the sandbox continue to pass without modification.
- Default `availableImages = new Set()` → all probes fire `onerror` → all TASK-083
  SVG assertions unchanged and unaffected.
- Stale-mood guard prevents a slow-loading probe for `pending` overwriting the `focused`
  expression that arrived with the response.

### Safety invariants maintained

- No `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` in renderer code.
- No external image URLs.
- No Live2D / Spine / 3D.
- `/chat` schema unchanged.
- Renderer does not call Ollama directly.

### Verification

- `node --check` renderer.js / renderer-chat-smoke.js / main.js: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS (22 tests: 18 + 4 new).
- Renderer code safety scan (`.js`/`.html`/`.css`): PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed, 0 failed.
- `git diff --check` on renderer source + smoke files: PASS.

## TASK-084 - Christina Visual Asset Pipeline

Status: DONE

### Summary

Established the formal asset directory structure, naming specification, and documentation
for Christina expression PNG assets. No renderer code was changed. No new images were
added beyond the user-provided reference.

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/`** — created directory tree:

- Naming spec: `christina_<mood>.png`, RGBA PNG, 512×512 recommended, transparent bg
- 10-mood table with filenames and current status
- Rollout strategy: neutral first, then add moods only as assets are ready
- Fallback strategy: renderer falls back to inline SVG if PNG absent
- Safety rules: no Ollama URLs, no external image URLs, no Live2D/Spine/3D

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/README.md`** — new
- Per-expression status table
- Crop parameters and generation script reference
- Asset pipeline for contributors

### Verification

- Directory structure confirmed via `find` / `ls` checks.
- No renderer JS changes.
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed (unchanged).

## TASK-085 - Create Christina Neutral Expression PNG

Status: DONE

### Summary

Generated `christina_neutral.png` (512×512 RGBA) from the reference image using
Python Pillow. Created a reproducible crop script. No renderer changes. No other
mood images created.

### Crop Strategy

- Source: `reference/christina_v0_reference.png` (1024×1536 RGBA, 2.1 MB)
- Crop region: left=59, right=983, top=0, bottom=844 (top 55% of height)
  → captures horns, face, and upper-body with natural frame
- Pad to square (924×924) with transparent fill, centred
- Lanczos scale to 512×512

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/scripts/create-christina-neutral-asset.py`** — new
- Reproducible Pillow crop script with constants for all crop parameters
- Writes to `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_neutral.png`

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_neutral.png`** — new
- 512×512 RGBA PNG, 337 KB
- Non-transparent bbox: (18, 29, 512, 492) — content fills 96.5%×90.4% of canvas
- Transparent background confirmed (all corners α=0)
- No white fringe, no black background contamination

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/README.md`** — updated
- `christina_neutral.png` status: ✅ Done

### Verification

- File size and dimensions confirmed via Pillow.
- Alpha channel integrity confirmed.
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed (unchanged).
- No renderer code changes.

## TASK-086 - Renderer Image Asset Fallback

Status: DONE

### Summary

Added PNG-with-SVG-fallback logic to `setPetExpression()`. Renderer probes each mood's
PNG asset via `new Image()`; if the file loads, the SVG placeholder is replaced with
`<img>`; if absent or fails, the inline SVG remains. All 18 pre-existing smoke tests
pass unchanged. 4 new smoke tests cover the new behaviour.

### Strategy

1. Set inline SVG immediately on every mood change (no visible flash).
2. Probe `assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_${mood}.png` via `new Image()`.
3. `onload` → replace SVG with `<img style="object-fit:contain">` (stale-mood guard).
4. `onerror` → keep SVG placeholder. UI never breaks.
5. `typeof Image === "undefined"` guard makes probe a no-op in Node.js test sandbox.

### Changes

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`**
- `setPetExpression()` updated with image probe + SVG fallback (TASK-086 strategy).

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`**
- Added `.pet-face img` rule: `object-fit: contain; width: 100%; height: 100%; display: block`.

**`apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`**
- Added `FakeImageBase` class and per-test `FakeImage` closure over `availableImages: Set`.
- `loadRenderer()` now accepts `options.availableImages` — default empty set keeps all
  existing tests unaffected (all probes fire `onerror`, SVG stays).
- 4 new test functions registered in `main()`:
  1. `testNeutralMoodUsesPngImageWhenAvailable`
  2. `testPngLoadFailureFallsBackToSvg`
  3. `testFocusedMoodFallsBackToSvgWhenNoPng`
  4. `testImageAssetDoesNotBreakSourceOrMoodLabel`

### Safety invariants maintained

- Renderer does NOT call Ollama directly.
- No `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` in renderer source.
- No external image URLs. No Live2D / Spine / 3D.
- `/chat` schema unchanged. API key never logged.

### Verification

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer` (renderer-chat-smoke): PASS — 22 tests (18 existing + 4 new).
- Renderer safety scan for `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, bare `11434`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS (LF/CRLF warnings only).
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed.

## TASK-087 - Neutral PNG Electron Visual Verification

Status: DONE

### Summary

Performed offline pixel-level visual verification of `christina_neutral.png` in the
80×80 pet display container. Electron cannot be launched headlessly in the CI sandbox,
so verification used Pillow alpha/bbox analysis and renderer code inspection.

### PNG quality analysis

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas size | 512×512 RGBA | ✅ |
| Non-transparent bbox | (18, 29, 512, 492) | ✅ tight crop |
| Content fill | 494×463px — 96.5% wide, 90.4% tall | ✅ fills canvas |
| Fully transparent pixels | 128,620 (49.1%) | ✅ clean alpha bg |
| Fully opaque pixels | 113,893 (43.4%) | ✅ |
| Semi-transparent pixels | 19,631 (7.5%) | ✅ natural anti-aliasing |
| Corner pixels (α) | all α=0 | ✅ no black background |
| White fringe at bbox edges | 0% | ✅ no white border |

### 80×80 container assessment

With `object-fit: contain` in the 80×80 `.pet-face` div:
- Rendered character: ~77×72px (96% wide, 90% tall of container)
- Verdict: **ACCEPTABLE** — character fills nearly the entire container
- No clipping of horns or head (top margin 29px in 512px canvas → ~4.5px at 80px)
- No black background bleed (all corners fully transparent)
- No white fringe
- The `object-fit: contain` CSS rule (added in TASK-086) prevents any cropping

### Renderer behaviour confirmed

- On startup: `setMood("neutral")` → `setPetExpression("neutral")` is called.
- `setPetExpression` probes `assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_neutral.png`.
- Because the file exists, `probe.onload` fires → SVG is replaced with `<img>`.
- Result: **PNG is displayed, not the SVG fallback**.
- For all other moods (no PNG yet): `probe.onerror` fires → SVG placeholder shown.
- No renderer calls Ollama directly. No external image URLs.

### Decision: no changes required

- 80×80 container is adequate for the current neutral expression crop.
- Issue was crop tightness (96% fill), not container size — there is no need to enlarge.
- `object-fit: contain` already handles aspect ratio and prevents clipping.
- No renderer changes, no CSS changes, no re-crop needed.

### Files changed

None — this was a read-only verification task.

### Verification

- Pillow bbox/alpha analysis: PASS (see analysis above).
- `renderer.js` code review: probe path, stale-mood guard, fallback logic all correct.
- No new tests needed (TASK-086 smoke tests already cover PNG success/failure paths).
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed (unchanged).

### Next step

TASK-087 is the final task in the Phase 4 Extension — Local Ollama Provider Track.
The Local Ollama MVP checkpoint is complete. Suggested next tracks:
- Phase 5 planning (task management, project context, tool execution framework)
- Additional expression PNGs for remaining 9 moods (happy, focused, proud, etc.)
- UI polish pass (container sizing, chat layout, scrollback behaviour)

## TASK-089 - Create Christina Focused Expression PNG

Status: DONE

Goal:
Create the second formal Christina expression PNG asset at
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/christina_focused.png`.

Implementation Summary:
- Created `christina_focused.png` as a v0 temporary duplicate placeholder copied from
  `christina_neutral.png`.
- Preserved the same crop style, character scale, 512x512 canvas, RGBA mode, and
  transparent alpha channel as the neutral asset.
- Updated Christina asset README files to clearly mark focused as a temporary
  duplicate placeholder, not a true focused/attentive expression yet.
- Updated root README and ROADMAP to record the focused placeholder checkpoint.
- No renderer behavior was changed.
- `/chat` schema was not changed.
- No external image URL, Live2D, Spine, or 3D asset was added.

Asset Verification:
- `christina_focused.png`: 512x512 PNG.
- Mode: RGBA, 8-bit PNG color type 6.
- Alpha: present, min 0, max 255.
- File size: 345,368 bytes / 337.3 KB.
- Placeholder status: temporary duplicate of `christina_neutral.png`.

Validation:
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- Renderer safety scan for direct Ollama URL / `11434`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS with LF/CRLF warnings only.

Next Task:
TASK-090 - Christina Real Expression Asset Plan

---

## TASK-090 - Christina Real Expression Asset Plan

Status: DONE

Goal:
Document the real Christina expression asset plan and prompt specifications so
future tasks replace placeholder/fallback moods with true mood-specific PNGs.

Current Expression State:

| Mood | PNG state | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` | real v0 asset | PNG displayed |
| `focused` | temporary duplicate placeholder | PNG displayed, visually same as neutral |
| `happy` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `proud` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `annoyed` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `worried` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `sleepy` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `pending` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `error` | missing | SVG fallback |
| `offline` | missing | SVG fallback |

Implementation Summary:
- Updated Christina asset README to keep `focused` clearly marked as a duplicate
  placeholder and to stop creating additional duplicate placeholder PNGs.
- Updated expression status table with current PNG/fallback state.
- Added `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/EXPRESSION_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`.
- Added production rules: same character design, 512x512 RGBA PNG, transparent
  background, same crop style as neutral, readable at 80x80, no external URL,
  no Live2D/Spine/3D, and no `/chat` schema change.
- Added prompt drafts for `happy`, `proud`, `annoyed`, `focused`, `worried`,
  `sleepy`, `pending`, `error`, and `offline`.
- No renderer behavior was changed.
- No new duplicate PNG was created.

2. `proud`
3. `annoyed`
4. `focused` real replacement
5. `worried`
6. `sleepy`
7. `pending`

## TASK-091 - Integrate Existing Christina Expression PNG Assets

Status: DONE

Goal:
Integrate and validate the existing user-provided Christina expression PNG assets
without regenerating images or changing renderer behavior.

Integrated Assets:

| Mood | File | Size | Mode | Alpha | Runtime behavior |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| `neutral` | `christina_neutral.png` | 512x512 / 345,368 bytes | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | PNG displayed |
| `focused` | `christina_focused.png` | 1024x1536 / 2,080,881 bytes | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | PNG displayed |
| `happy` | `christina_happy.png` | 1030x1527 / 2,212,034 bytes | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | PNG displayed |
| `proud` | `christina_proud.png` | 1024x1536 / 2,117,924 bytes | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | PNG displayed |
| `annoyed` | `christina_annoyed.png` | 1029x1528 / 2,658,453 bytes | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | PNG displayed |
| `worried` | missing | n/a | n/a | n/a | SVG fallback |
| `sleepy` | missing | n/a | n/a | n/a | SVG fallback |
| `pending` | missing | n/a | n/a | n/a | SVG fallback |
| `error` | missing | n/a | n/a | n/a | SVG fallback |
| `offline` | missing | n/a | n/a | n/a | SVG fallback |

Implementation Summary:
- Confirmed all five expected PNG files exist in
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/`.
- Confirmed all five files are PNG RGBA assets with transparent alpha.
- Confirmed `focused` is no longer byte-identical to `neutral`; it is now a
  user-provided real focused asset, not the TASK-089 duplicate placeholder.
- Recorded that `focused`, `happy`, `proud`, and `annoyed` are larger than the
  ideal 512x512 face/bust spec, but load through the existing renderer PNG path.
- Updated renderer smoke tests to verify integrated PNG loading for `neutral`,
  `focused`, `happy`, `proud`, and `annoyed`, plus SVG fallback for missing moods.
- No renderer behavior was changed.
- `/chat` schema was not changed.
- No image was regenerated.
- No external image URL, Live2D, Spine, or 3D asset was added.

Validation:
- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.

## TASK-092 - Christina Expression Visual QA and 512x512 Normalization Review

Status: DONE

Goal:
Review the integrated Christina expression PNGs in the actual 80x80 pet display
context and decide whether 512x512 face/bust normalization is needed.

QA Decision:
- Current assets are functional and renderer-compatible.
- `neutral` is the only mood visually consistent with the 80x80 face/bust spec.
- `focused`, `happy`, `proud`, and `annoyed` should be normalized into 512x512
  face/bust crops that match neutral before they are treated as final UI assets.
- Do not overwrite original full-body user-provided PNGs until normalized outputs pass QA.
- Do not resize the pet display as the first fix — framing inconsistency is the root cause.

Constraints Maintained:
- No new expression image was created.
- No runtime renderer behavior was changed.
- `/chat` schema was not changed.
- No external image URL, Live2D, Spine, or 3D asset was added.
- Renderer still has no direct Ollama URL.

Validation:

## TASK-093 - Normalize Existing Christina Expression PNGs to 512x512 Face/Bust

Status: DONE

Goal:
Create a reproducible normalization script and QA-only 512x512 face/bust
candidates from the existing full-body Christina expression PNGs, without
overwriting runtime assets.

Implementation Summary:
- Added `apps/desktop/scripts/normalize-christina-expression-assets.py`.
- The script reads existing runtime PNGs for `focused`, `happy`, `proud`, and `annoyed`.
- The script writes candidates to
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/candidates/`.
- Added `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expression-normalization-preview.html`.
- Added `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/candidates/README.md`.
- Runtime files `christina_focused.png`, `christina_happy.png`,
  `christina_proud.png`, and `christina_annoyed.png` were not overwritten.
- No renderer runtime behavior was changed.
- `/chat` schema was not changed.
- No new mood image was added.
- No external image URL, Live2D, Spine, or 3D asset was added.

Candidate Outputs:

| Mood | Candidate | Size | Mode | Alpha | File size |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---:|
| `focused` | `christina_focused_512_candidate.png` | 512x512 | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | 406,211 bytes |
| `happy` | `christina_happy_512_candidate.png` | 512x512 | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | 408,362 bytes |
| `proud` | `christina_proud_512_candidate.png` | 512x512 | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | 389,606 bytes |
| `annoyed` | `christina_annoyed_512_candidate.png` | 512x512 | RGBA | min 0 / max 255 | 393,336 bytes |

Crop Strategy:

| Mood | Source crop | Strategy note |
|---|---|---|
| `focused` | x50-y0 to x973-y843 | top 55% face/bust crop; preserves horns and reaching hand |
| `happy` | x53-y0 to x976-y843 | top face/bust crop centered to match neutral scale |
| `proud` | x50-y0 to x973-y843 | top face/bust crop; preserves horns and smug face |
| `annoyed` | x52-y0 to x975-y843 | top face/bust crop; preserves horns and annoyed face |

## TASK-094 - Approve Normalized Christina Candidates and Replace Runtime PNGs

Status: DONE

### Summary

Promoted four 512x512 normalized face/bust candidate PNGs to runtime, replacing the
previous full-body originals (1024x1536, 2-2.6 MB each). All five active expression
PNGs are now consistently 512x512 RGBA face/bust crops. Full-body originals are
archived in `expressions/originals/`. No renderer code was changed.

### Pre-promotion vs post-promotion runtime PNGs

| Mood | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` | 512x512 RGBA, 337 KB | unchanged |
| `focused` | 1024x1536 RGBA, 2.0 MB | 512x512 RGBA, 396 KB |
| `happy` | 1030x1527 RGBA, 2.2 MB | 512x512 RGBA, 398 KB |
| `proud` | 1024x1536 RGBA, 2.1 MB | 512x512 RGBA, 380 KB |
| `annoyed` | 1029x1528 RGBA, 2.6 MB | 512x512 RGBA, 384 KB |

### Safety invariants maintained

- Renderer code unchanged.
- No external image URLs. No Live2D/Spine/3D. No Ollama URL in renderer.

## TASK-095 - Create Christina Worried and Sleepy Expression PNGs

Status: BLOCKED (initial) -> DONE (TASK-095-RESUME)

### Summary

TASK-095 initial run: BLOCKED awaiting source images.
TASK-095-RESUME: User-provided source images for `worried` and `sleepy` were found
in the expressions directory. Applied the same normalization pipeline as TASK-093/094
to produce 512x512 RGBA face/bust crops. All 7 active runtime expression PNGs are now
consistently 512x512 RGBA with transparent backgrounds. No renderer code was changed.

### Source images found

| Mood | File | Original size | File size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `worried` | `christina_worried.png` (pre-normalization) | 1030x1527 RGBA | ~2007 KB |
| `sleepy` | `christina_sleepy.png` (pre-normalization) | 1024x1536 RGBA | ~1894 KB |

### Normalization pipeline

Same method as TASK-093 / TASK-094:
1. Computed content bounding box from alpha channel.
2. Took top 55% of image height as the face/bust crop region.
3. Centered the crop horizontally on the content.
4. Removed edge-connected light/white background artifacts (flood-fill from edges).
5. Padded shorter axis with transparent fill to produce a square crop.
6. Lanczos scaled to 512x512.

Crop boxes used:
- `worried`: (61, 0, 985, 840)
- `sleepy`: (43, 0, 967, 845)

### Post-normalization runtime PNG verification (all 7 PNGs)

| Mood | Size | Mode | Fill at 80x80 | Corners alpha=0 | KB | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| neutral | 512x512 | RGBA | 96%x90% | YES | 337 | PASS |
| focused | 512x512 | RGBA | 98%x90% | YES | 396 | PASS |
| happy | 512x512 | RGBA | 94%x90% | YES | 398 | PASS |
| proud | 512x512 | RGBA | 96%x91% | YES | 380 | PASS |
| annoyed | 512x512 | RGBA | 92%x90% | YES | 384 | PASS |

## TASK-096 - Create Christina System-State Expression PNGs

Status: BLOCKED -- awaiting source images

### Summary

TASK-096 cannot be completed without user-provided source images for the three
remaining system-state moods (`pending`, `error`, `offline`). No fake or
duplicate-placeholder PNGs were created.

### Blocker

Source image audit result:
- No user-provided `pending`, `error`, or `offline` PNG assets found in:
  - `apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/`
  - Any uploads directory
- No local image generation tools available in the sandbox.
- Generating AI artwork programmatically without a base model is not possible.

Renderer fallback status (unchanged, correct):
- `pending`: SVG fallback active -- no PNG present.
- `error`: SVG fallback active -- no PNG present.
- `offline`: SVG fallback active -- no PNG present.
- This is safe and functional; SVG expressions are defined for all three moods.

Current expression PNG status after TASK-095-RESUME:

| Mood | PNG state | KB |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` | 512x512 RGBA | 337 |
| `focused` | 512x512 RGBA | 396 |
| `happy` | 512x512 RGBA | 398 |
| `proud` | 512x512 RGBA | 380 |
| `annoyed` | 512x512 RGBA | 384 |
| `worried` | 512x512 RGBA | 325 |
| `sleepy` | 512x512 RGBA | 302 |
| `pending` | SVG fallback | -- |
| `error` | SVG fallback | -- |
| `offline` | SVG fallback | -- |

### Required to unblock

One of the following:

**Option A** -- User provides source images (same workflow as TASK-095-RESUME).
Provide RGBA PNG files with transparent backgrounds for pending, error, and offline
expressions matching the Christina v0 character design. Drop files in
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/assets/pet/christina/expressions/` or upload in
the next Cowork session, then re-run TASK-096-RESUME.

**Option B** -- Generate via external AI image tool.
Use the prompts below with an AI image generator (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable
Diffusion, etc.), then provide the output PNGs.

**Option C** -- Defer.
Keep SVG fallback active for all three system-state moods. Revisit when source
material is available. The renderer handles this gracefully with no UI breakage.

### Files changed

None -- no PNG files were created or modified.

## TASK-097 - Expression Set Checkpoint and Commit Review

Status: DONE

### Summary

Checkpoint review of the Christina expression asset set. The working tree is in a
stable, commit-ready state. 7 of 10 moods have real 512x512 RGBA PNGs; 3 system-state
moods (pending, error, offline) remain on SVG fallback with TASK-096 correctly marked
BLOCKED. One stale file (EXPRESSION_GENERATION_GUIDE.md) was updated to reflect the
current 7-PNG state and remaining work.

### git status audit

## TASK-098 - UI Polish Pass

Status: DONE

### Summary

UI polish pass on the Electron desktop app. Made the chat scrollback reliable,
enlarged the pet display from 80px to 112px, replaced raw source labels with
friendly user-facing text, improved provider settings readability with boolean
badges, and added 2 new smoke tests (24 total). No new expression PNGs were
added. No `/chat` schema was changed. No Ollama URL was introduced.

### Files changed

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`** -- MODIFIED
- Pet face size: 80px -> 112px; display padding 10px -> 14px; gap 4px -> 6px
- Pet display hint: font-size 11px -> 12px; added `min-height: 18px`
- Chat area: `min-height: 200px` -> `240px`; `max-height: 38vh` -> `44vh`; gap 12px -> 10px
- `.status-note`: font-size 13px -> 12px; color `var(--text-muted)`; overflow ellipsis
- `.chat-runtime-pill`: muted color, font-size 12px, padding 2px 7px
- Added `.chat-runtime-pill.friendly`: stronger color, font-size 13px, font-weight 500
- `.provider-status-grid strong`: font-size 15px -> 14px
- Added `strong[data-bool="true"]` green badge; `strong[data-bool="false"]` muted badge
- Media query max-height threshold: 320px -> 360px

**`apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`** -- MODIFIED
- Added `sourceLabel(source)` function: maps source strings to friendly labels
  (e.g. `llm_local` -> "Local Ollama", `mock` -> "Mock fallback", `backend_offline` -> "Backend offline")
- Added `moodHintLabel(mood)` function: maps mood strings to user-facing hint text
  (e.g. `pending` -> "Thinking...", `error` -> "Something went wrong", `offline` -> "Offline")
- Updated `setChatRuntimeStatus()`: `chatSourceStatus` unchanged (smoke-test-safe),
  `chatProviderStatus` now shows `sourceLabel(lastChatSource)` with `.friendly` CSS class
- Updated `syncChatRuntimeProviderStatus()`: before first chat shows `provider: ${p}`,
  after shows `sourceLabel(lastChatSource)`
- Updated `appendMessage()`: renamed sender "Dragon Pet" -> "Christina"; added
  `requestAnimationFrame` guard for scroll-to-bottom (safe in Node.js test sandbox)
- Updated `setMood()`: uses `moodHintLabel(mood)` instead of raw mood string for pet hint
- Updated `renderProviderSettings()`: added `dataset.bool` attributes on boolean fields
  for CSS badge styling (`"true"` -> green, `"false"` -> muted gray)
- Error paths: `setPetHint(moodHintLabel("offline"))`, `setPetHint(moodHintLabel("error"))`

**`apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`** -- MODIFIED
- Added `this.dataset = {}` to `FakeElement` constructor (required for `dataset.bool` in renderer)
- Added `testChatAreaAccumulatesMultipleMessages()`: sends 3 messages in mock mode,
  verifies 3 user messages + >=3 pet replies accumulate in DOM using `children.filter()`
- Added `testFriendlySourceLabelShownAfterLocalChat()`: verifies `chat-source-status`
  = "source: llm_local" (unchanged) AND `chat-provider-status` = "Local Ollama" (new)
- Total tests: 22 -> 24

### Note: file truncation repairs

Both `renderer.js` and `renderer-chat-smoke.js` were found truncated at the start of
this session (NTFS stale cache / partial write from prior context window). Both were
repaired using bash Python direct writes before running verification checks.

### Pet display size

Adjusted from 80px to 112px. The 7 existing 512x512 RGBA PNGs display clearly at
this size with `object-fit: contain`. No cropping of horns or face occurs.

### Chat scrollback

Auto-scroll to bottom implemented with `requestAnimationFrame` guard. Messages use
`.message.user` / `.message.pet` / `.message.status` / `.message.error` className
structure. Loading and error messages do not break layout.

### Runtime status strategy

- `chat-source-status` pill: unchanged format `source: <value>` -- smoke tests depend on this
- `chat-runtime-status`: unchanged regex-compatible format -- smoke tests depend on this
- `chat-provider-status` pill (not tested by prior smoke tests): repurposed as user-facing
  friendly label ("Local Ollama", "Mock fallback", "Backend offline", etc.) with `.friendly` CSS class

### Provider settings readability

Boolean fields (`real_provider_enabled`, `llm_chat_enabled`, `fallback_to_mock`) now
render with `data-bool="true"` / `data-bool="false"` attributes and corresponding CSS
badges (green for true, muted gray for false). Numeric usage counts rendered as `<dt>`/`<dd>` pairs.

### Safety invariants maintained

- Renderer still has no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434`.
- `/chat` schema unchanged: `reply / mood / source`.
- No external image URLs. No Live2D/Spine/3D. No new expression PNGs.
- No persona prompt changes. No backend provider logic changes.
- API key not logged, not in localStorage, not sent to frontend.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest`: 555 passed, 0 failed
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS (after truncation repair)
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS (after truncation repair)
- `npm run test:renderer` (24 tests): PASS
- Renderer safety scan (js/html/css): PASS -- no Ollama URL
- `git diff --check`: CRLF/BOM warnings only in `backend/README.md` (pre-existing, non-blocking)

## TASK-099 — Desktop Settings Persistence Review

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-22

### Goal

Audit where non-secret provider settings are stored on the desktop and implement minimal
backend-side JSON persistence so that provider / model / feature-flag choices survive
app restarts.  API keys must never be written to the plain JSON file.

### Audit outcome

`ProviderSettingsService` was purely in-memory (dataclass + asyncio Lock).  On restart
all state reverted to environment-variable defaults.  No Electron `userData` persistence
existed.  `runtime_overridden` flag was always `False` after a fresh process.

### Implementation

#### `backend/app/core/config.py`
Added `get_settings_file_path()`:
- Default path: `data/provider_settings.json` (relative to backend working directory).
- Override with `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH` env var; empty string disables persistence entirely.
- Safety: only non-secret fields ever reach this file.

#### `backend/app/services/provider_settings_service.py` (full rewrite, 377 lines)
- Added `_PERSIST_FIELDS = frozenset({"provider","model","real_provider_enabled","llm_chat_enabled","fallback_to_mock"})` whitelist.
- `_load_settings_from_file(path)`: reads JSON, validates it is a dict, filters to `_PERSIST_FIELDS`, returns `None` on any error (missing file, corrupt JSON, wrong type).
- `_save_settings_to_file(path, settings)`: serialises only `_PERSIST_FIELDS`; atomic write via `.tmp` + `os.replace()`; creates parent directory with `os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)`; `f.flush(); os.fsync()` before rename.
- `ProviderSettingsService.__init__` accepts `settings_file_path: str | None = None` (defaults to env-var path); calls `_try_load_from_file()` on construction.
- `_try_load_from_file()`: seeds `_settings` from file and sets `_runtime_overridden = True` so `chat_service` routes through in-memory settings.
- `update_settings()`: saves to file after in-memory update (outside lock).
- `reset()`: clears memory only — does NOT delete the file.
- Module-level `_service = ProviderSettingsService()` uses env-var path by default.

#### `backend/data/.gitkeep`
Placeholder so the `data/` directory is tracked in git.

#### `.gitignore`
Appended two lines to exclude the settings file and its `.tmp` sibling.

#### `backend/tests/test_provider_settings_persistence.py` (282 lines, new)
20 tests across three suites:
- `TestLoadSettingsFromFile` (5): happy path, filters unknown keys, missing file, corrupt JSON, wrong JSON type.
- `TestSaveSettingsToFile` (5): round-trip, never writes secret fields, creates parent directory, empty path is no-op, `None` model serialises correctly.
- `TestProviderSettingsServicePersistence` (10): save→reload restores settings, loaded settings mark `runtime_overridden=True`, corrupt file falls back to defaults, API key never written to file, reset clears memory but keeps file, disabled persistence with empty path, `update_settings` persists on every call, `reset` does not remove file, defaults load when file absent, `llm_chat_enabled` persists correctly.

### Safety invariants maintained

- API key (`LLM_API_KEY`) is **never** written to the JSON file; `_PERSIST_FIELDS` whitelist excludes it.
- `key_status` and all other secret-adjacent fields are also excluded.
- `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH=""` disables persistence entirely (used in test isolation).
- Renderer still has no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434`.
- `/chat` schema unchanged.
- No external image URLs, no persona prompt changes, no backend provider logic changes.

## TASK-099 — Desktop Settings Persistence Review

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-22

### Goal

Audit where non-secret provider settings are stored on the desktop and implement minimal
backend-side JSON persistence so that provider / model / feature-flag choices survive
app restarts.  API keys must never be written to the plain JSON file.

### Audit outcome

`ProviderSettingsService` was purely in-memory (dataclass + asyncio Lock).  On restart
all state reverted to environment-variable defaults.  No Electron `userData` persistence
existed.  `runtime_overridden` flag was always `False` after a fresh process.

### Implementation

#### `backend/app/core/config.py`
Added `get_settings_file_path()`:
- Default path: `data/provider_settings.json` (relative to backend working directory).
- Override with `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH` env var; empty string disables persistence entirely.
- Safety: only non-secret fields ever reach this file.

#### `backend/app/services/provider_settings_service.py` (full rewrite, 377 lines)
- Added `_PERSIST_FIELDS` whitelist: `provider`, `model`, `real_provider_enabled`, `llm_chat_enabled`, `fallback_to_mock`.
- `_load_settings_from_file(path)`: reads JSON, validates it is a dict, filters to `_PERSIST_FIELDS`, returns None on any error.
- `_save_settings_to_file(path, settings)`: serialises only `_PERSIST_FIELDS`; atomic write via `.tmp` + `os.replace()`; creates parent directory; `f.flush(); os.fsync()` before rename.
- `ProviderSettingsService.__init__` accepts `settings_file_path: str | None = None`; calls `_try_load_from_file()` on construction.
- `_try_load_from_file()`: seeds `_settings` from file and sets `_runtime_overridden = True`.
- `update_settings()`: saves to file after in-memory update.
- `reset()`: clears memory only; does NOT delete the file.

#### `backend/data/.gitkeep`
Placeholder so the `data/` directory is tracked in git.

#### `.gitignore`
Appended exclusions for `backend/data/provider_settings.json` and `.tmp` sibling.

#### `backend/tests/test_provider_settings_persistence.py` (282 lines, new)
20 tests across three suites:
- `TestLoadSettingsFromFile` (5): happy path, filters unknown keys, missing file, corrupt JSON, wrong JSON type.
- `TestSaveSettingsToFile` (5): round-trip, never writes secret fields, creates parent directory, empty path is no-op, None model serialises correctly.
- `TestProviderSettingsServicePersistence` (10): save/reload, runtime_overridden after load, corrupt file fallback, API key exclusion, reset keeps file, disabled persistence, persistence on every update, defaults when file absent, llm_chat_enabled persists.

### Safety invariants maintained

- API key (`LLM_API_KEY`) is never written to the JSON file; `_PERSIST_FIELDS` whitelist excludes it.
- `key_status` and all secret-adjacent fields are also excluded.
- `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH=""` disables persistence entirely (used in test isolation).
- Renderer still has no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434`.
- `/chat` schema unchanged.
- No external image URLs, no persona prompt changes, no backend provider logic changes.

## TASK-100 — Settings Persistence Runtime Smoke

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-22

### Goal

Runtime smoke test confirming that TASK-099 persistence actually works end-to-end:
provider settings survive a backend restart and `/chat` routing uses the restored settings.

### Smoke procedure

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Start backend (env=mock/disabled, no settings file yet) | `GET /provider/settings` → provider=mock, llm_chat_enabled=False ✓ |
| 2 | `PATCH /provider/settings` (provider=ollama, model=qwen3:8b, enabled=true, fallback=true) | Returns updated settings ✓ |
| 3 | Inspect `provider_settings.json` | Written with exactly 5 non-secret fields ✓ |
| 4 | Secret-field audit | No `api_key`, `key_status`, `resolved_provider`, `usage_summary`, `last_test_status` ✓ |
| 5 | Stop backend | Process terminated |
| 6 | Restart backend (env=mock/disabled — file should override) | Started cleanly ✓ |
| 7 | `GET /provider/settings` after restart | provider=ollama, model=qwen3:8b, llm_chat_enabled=True, resolved_provider=ollama ✓ |
| 8 | `POST /chat` | source=mock (Ollama not installed in sandbox → fallback fired); fallback_count=1 confirms Ollama was attempted ✓ |
| 9 | `git check-ignore` | `backend/data/provider_settings.json` matched by .gitignore line 34 ✓ |

### JSON file content (step 3)

```json
{
  "provider": "ollama",
  "model": "qwen3:8b",
  "real_provider_enabled": true,
  "llm_chat_enabled": true,
  "fallback_to_mock": true
}
```

Exactly `_PERSIST_FIELDS`. No secrets.

### Note on `source=llm_local`

The task spec asked for `source=llm_local`.  Ollama is not installed in the CI/sandbox
environment, so the LLM call raised a connection error.  `fallback_to_mock=true` was
set, so the response fell back to mock with `source=mock`.  The `fallback_count=1`
entry in `usage_summary` is definitive proof that the Ollama code path was entered
(not skipped in favour of the plain mock path).  On a host with `ollama serve` running
and `qwen3:8b` pulled, the same flow produces `source=llm_local`.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest`: **576 passed, 0 failed**
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS
- `npm run test:renderer` (24 smoke tests): PASS
- Renderer safety scan: PASS (no Ollama URL)
- `git diff --check`: CRLF/BOM warnings only in `backend/README.md` (pre-existing, non-blocking)
- `git check-ignore backend/data/provider_settings.json`: matched (not tracked) ✓

## TASK-101-RERUN — Post-TASK-102 Runtime Smoke

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-23

### Goal

Re-run full runtime smoke after TASK-102 fixes to confirm every behavioral guard is in effect:
partial PATCH preservation, explicit null model guard, Test Connection no-mutate, Electron
no-PATCH, cold-start /chat UX, persistence after restart, and secret/git safety.

### Verification results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `python -m pytest` | **586 passed, 0 failed** |
| `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js` | PASS |
| `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js` | PASS |
| `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js` | PASS |
| `npm run test:renderer` | PASS |
| Renderer safety scan (no direct Ollama URL) | PASS |
| `git diff --check` (source files only) | PASS |
| `git diff --check` (all) | Pre-existing CRLF in `backend/README.md` only — non-blocking |

### Smoke results

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `GET /health` | `{"status":"ok","service":"dragon-pet-ai"}` ✓ |
| 2 | `PATCH /provider/settings` (full) | provider=ollama, model=qwen3:8b, fallback_to_mock=False ✓ |
| 3 | Inspect JSON file | `{"provider":"ollama","model":"qwen3:8b","real_provider_enabled":true,"llm_chat_enabled":true,"fallback_to_mock":false}` — no secrets ✓ |
| 4 | Partial PATCH (`provider=ollama` only) | model=qwen3:8b preserved, fallback_to_mock=False preserved ✓ |
| 5 | Explicit null model PATCH (`model:null`) | model=qwen3:8b unchanged ✓ |
| 6 | Test Connection then check JSON file | JSON byte-identical before/after — no mutation ✓ |
| 7 | `POST /chat` (Ollama not in sandbox) | source=llm_local_error, fallback_count=0 (fallback disabled) ✓ |
| 8 | Usage summary | error_counts={'ollama_unavailable':2} — Ollama path entered, no silent skip ✓ |
| 9 | Stop → restart → `GET /provider/settings` | provider=ollama, model=qwen3:8b, real_provider_enabled=True, llm_chat_enabled=True, fallback_to_mock=False ✓ |

### Guards confirmed

- **Partial PATCH**: omitted fields not overwritten.
- **Explicit null model**: `model:null` PATCH does not clear existing model.
- **Test Connection no-mutate**: settings JSON byte-identical before and after.
- **Electron no-PATCH**: verified via renderer smoke test `testProviderSettingsStatusAndTestConnectionSuccess` (static check — Electron not running in sandbox).
- **Cold-start /chat**: `source=llm_local_error`, schema `reply/mood/source` unchanged, fallback=0 when disabled.
- **Warm /chat**: not verifiable in sandbox (Ollama not installed); expected `source=llm_local` on host with `ollama serve`.
- **Persistence**: all five persisted fields restored after backend restart.
- **Git safety**: `backend/data/provider_settings.json` gitignored; no API key in any tracked file.

### Commit recommendation

Commit scope: TASK-099 + TASK-100 + TASK-102 + TASK-101-RERUN verification.
Tag candidate: `v0.5.2-settings-persist`.

## TASK-102 - Provider Settings Partial Persist Guard + Ollama Cold Start UX

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-22

### Goal

Prevent partial provider-settings writes from overwriting persisted complete settings, and
improve local Ollama cold-start timeout/error UX without changing `/chat` schema or renderer
provider boundaries.

### Root cause reviewed

The persistence layer already skipped `None` values, but the PATCH route converted omitted
request fields into explicit `None` values before constructing the service update object.
The renderer also allowed Save Non-secret Settings before provider settings had loaded,
which could submit default checkbox/input values instead of the restored checkpoint state.
Full-suite pytest also used the module-level provider settings service without disabling the
runtime settings path, so tests could mutate the developer's ignored
`backend/data/provider_settings.json`.

`/provider/settings/test` does not persist provider settings. This is now covered by
backend and renderer smoke tests.

### Implementation

- Provider settings PATCH now preserves omitted fields with `exclude_unset=True`.
- Empty model text in the renderer Save flow is omitted from the PATCH body instead of being
  sent as `null`.
- Save Non-secret Settings is disabled until the current provider settings load successfully.
- Test Connection remains a read-only provider check and does not write settings JSON.
- Added `LLM_LOCAL_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for local `/chat` generation timeout.
- Local chat timeout default is 90 seconds, clamped to 1..300.
- Legacy `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` still works as a compatibility fallback.
- Local timeout safe reply now explains that the model may still be loading or waking up.
- Renderer local error status now includes the same cold-start hint.
- Added test-suite isolation so pytest disables the runtime settings file by default; persistence
  tests still use explicit temp files.

### Safety invariants maintained

- `/chat` schema unchanged: `reply / mood / source`.
- Renderer still has no direct Ollama URL.
- API keys are not persisted to `provider_settings.json`.
- Settings JSON remains whitelisted to non-secret fields only:
  `provider`, `model`, `real_provider_enabled`, `llm_chat_enabled`, `fallback_to_mock`.
- Test Connection still uses the lightweight backend local check; it does not perform full
  `/chat` generation.
- No persona prompt changes, no new image assets, no external provider call.

### Verification

- Targeted backend tests: 136 passed.
- `python -m pytest`: 586 passed.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- Renderer safety scan: PASS, no direct Ollama URL.
- `git diff --check`: PASS with CRLF normalization warnings only.

### Next Task

TASK-103 - Local Dev Launch / One-command Startup

---

## TASK-103 — Local Dev Launch / One-command Startup

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-23

### Goal

Improve the local development startup flow so developers can reliably start the full
Ollama + backend + Electron stack with a single command per service, and diagnose
common environment problems without reading source code.

### Changes

No product features added. No `/chat` schema changed. No provider routing changed.
No persona prompt changed. No images added. No renderer Ollama URL added.

**New files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/dev-start-backend.ps1` | Port check, venv activation, env vars, uvicorn start |
| `scripts/dev-start-desktop.ps1` | node_modules check, ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE clear, npm.cmd run dev |
| `scripts/dev-smoke.ps1` | /health, /provider/settings, /provider/settings/test, /chat smoke; reports source |
| `docs/LOCAL_DEV_RUNBOOK.md` | Full runbook: prerequisites, startup order, env var reference, troubleshooting |

**Updated files:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Added Quick Start section with one-liner scripts; updated pytest count to 586 |
| `backend/README.md` | Added one-command script call; added Ollama-mode manual env var block |

### Script features

**`dev-start-backend.ps1`:**
- Resolves repo root from script location (works from any working directory).
- Checks port 8000 with a 200 ms TCP probe; exits with `netstat`/`taskkill` guidance.
- Activates `backend\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` if present; warns if absent.
- Falls back to `python -m uvicorn` if `uvicorn` is not on PATH.
- Sets: `LLM_PROVIDER_NAME=ollama`, `LLM_MODEL=qwen3:8b`, `LLM_PROVIDER_ENABLED=true`, `LLM_CHAT_ENABLED=true`, `LLM_LOCAL_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=90`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.

**`dev-start-desktop.ps1`:**
- Checks `apps\desktop\node_modules` and prompts `npm.cmd install` if missing.
- Clears `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` via both env var assignment and `Remove-Item Env:\`.
- Uses `npm.cmd` (not `npm`) to avoid PowerShell execution-policy errors from `npm.ps1`.

**`dev-smoke.ps1`:**
- Fails fast on `/health` unreachable with a clear restart message.
- Reports provider, model, key_status, resolved_provider from `/provider/settings`.
- Sends `POST /provider/settings/test` with `explicit_cost_ack=true` (no API key).
- Sends `POST /chat`, verifies `reply/mood/source` schema, classifies source with actionable hints.
- Exit code 0 on all pass, 1 on any failure.

### Issues addressed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `uvicorn not on PATH` | Falls back to `python -m uvicorn`; startup script detects and uses it |
| `npm.ps1 execution policy` | All desktop calls use `npm.cmd` explicitly |
| `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` | Cleared in `dev-start-desktop.ps1` before `npm.cmd run dev` |
| Port 8000 occupied | 200 ms TCP probe; error message with `netstat`/`taskkill` commands |
| Cold-start timeout | `LLM_LOCAL_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=90`; smoke reports `llm_local_error` with retry hint |
| Settings not persisting | Runbook section explains JSON file, gitignore, and `git check-ignore` verification |

### Verification

- `python -m pytest`: **586 passed, 0 failed**
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS
- `npm run test:renderer`: PASS
- Renderer safety scan: PASS (no direct Ollama URL in renderer.js or any new script)
- Script safety scan: PASS (no API key values, no direct Ollama URL in scripts)
- `git diff --check`: git index corrupt (pre-existing NTFS sandbox lock from v0.5.2 commit); source files verified clean via grep

### Next Task

TASK-104 - Manual Windows Script Smoke

---

## TASK-104 — Manual Windows Script Smoke

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-23

### Goal

Manually verify the three TASK-103 PowerShell startup scripts on a real Windows host
with Ollama running, confirming that port checks, venv activation, npm.cmd routing,
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE clearing, and the full `/chat` round-trip all work end-to-end.

### Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` required | ✓ — PowerShell default blocks `.ps1`; Process-scope bypass is the recommended workaround and does not persist after the terminal closes |
| `dev-smoke.ps1` — `GET /health` | PASS |
| `dev-smoke.ps1` — `GET /provider/settings` | PASS |
| `dev-smoke.ps1` — `POST /provider/settings/test` | PASS |
| `dev-smoke.ps1` — `POST /chat` | PASS |
| `source` | `llm_local` — Ollama (`qwen3:8b`) generated the reply locally |
| `mood` | `happy` |
| `/chat` schema | `reply / mood / source` — unchanged |

### Cold-start note

The first `/chat` call timed out because `qwen3:8b` had not been loaded into memory yet.
After warming the model with `ollama run qwen3:8b` (or by waiting for Ollama to finish
loading), all subsequent smoke calls returned `source=llm_local` immediately.

**Recommended warm-up step** (add to personal runbook before first smoke run):

```powershell
# Warm up the model before running the smoke script
ollama run qwen3:8b
# Type a short message, wait for a reply, then Ctrl+D to exit
```

The `dev-start-backend.ps1` already sets `LLM_LOCAL_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=90`; on a
warm model this is more than sufficient.  On first cold-start after a pull, running
`ollama run` manually first avoids the timeout.

### ExecutionPolicy guidance (added to runbook)

```powershell
# Allow .ps1 scripts for this terminal session only (does not persist)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

This is already documented in `docs/LOCAL_DEV_RUNBOOK.md` under Common Errors.
No script logic was changed.

### Verification

- All four smoke checks: PASS
- `source=llm_local`: confirmed (real local Ollama generation, not mock)
- `/chat` schema: `reply / mood / source` — unchanged
- No product logic modified

### Next Task

TASK-105 - Cold-start Warmup UX for dev-smoke

---

## TASK-105 — Cold-start Warmup UX for dev-smoke

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-23

### Goal

Improve `scripts/dev-smoke.ps1` so that when the local `qwen3:8b` model is still
loading (cold-start), the script prints a clear, actionable warm-up hint instead of a
generic failure message. No backend provider logic changed. No `/chat` schema changed.
No renderer modified.

### Root cause

`Invoke-BackendPost` previously used `TimeoutSec 15` for `/chat`. The backend's own
`LLM_LOCAL_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to 90 s. On cold-start, the PowerShell
client timed out first (after 15 s) and raised a network exception, which was caught and
printed as a generic `[FAIL] /chat failed: ...` with no guidance. The
`source=llm_local_error` branch (which did have a partial hint) was never reached.

### Changes

**`scripts/dev-smoke.ps1`** only — no other file modified.

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| New `-ChatTimeoutSec` param | Default 100 s — intentionally above backend 90 s so backend can return JSON |
| New `Write-WarmupHint` function | Prints the exact `ollama run qwen3:8b` warm-up command and rerun instruction |
| New `Is-TimeoutError` helper | Detects PowerShell network-timeout exception messages |
| `/chat` network-timeout branch | Detects timeout, calls `Write-WarmupHint`, increments fail counter |
| `llm_local_error` branch improved | Checks reply text for cold-start keywords; if matched calls `Write-WarmupHint`; if not matched shows possible-causes list then `Write-WarmupHint` |
| `$WARN` tag added | `[WARN]` in Yellow — distinguishes transient cold-start from hard failures |
| Header shows timeout | `Chat timeout: N s` visible in smoke header |
| Cold-start note in header | `(cold-start may take up to 90 s on first load — please wait)` |

### Warm-up hint displayed on cold-start

```
[WARN] /chat request timed out at the network level (100 s).
[WARN] The backend may still be waiting for Ollama to load the model.

  *** Local model may still be loading / waking up ***

  Warm up the model by running this in a separate terminal:

    ollama run qwen3:8b "請用一句繁體中文回覆：ready"

  Wait until it replies, then rerun:

    .\scripts\dev-smoke.ps1

  This is a cold-start loading issue — not a settings or backend problem.
```

### Safety invariants

- `/chat` schema unchanged: `reply / mood / source`.
- Renderer not modified.
- No direct Ollama URL in any script.
- Backend provider logic not modified.
- `llm_local_error` is not counted as a hard failure (exit 0) — it is a transient
  cold-start state, not a broken backend or settings problem.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest`: **586 passed, 0 failed**
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`: PASS

- Renderer safety scan: PASS (no direct Ollama URL)
- `dev-smoke.ps1` safety scan: PASS (no direct Ollama URL, no API key)
- Trailing whitespace check on `dev-smoke.ps1`: CLEAN

## TASK-112：Phase 5 Companion Behavior Smoke Tests / Checkpoint

**狀態：DONE**
**日期：2026-05-24**

### 目標

不新增功能。針對 Phase 5 companion behavior（TASK-108~111）進行整體 smoke / checkpoint，
確認各流程整合穩定，補強測試覆蓋率，並更新文件。

### 範圍

- 純測試補強：不修改 `renderer.js`，不新增 backend route，不修改 `/chat` schema
- 檢查並補強 smoke 測試的覆蓋缺口：
  - **error/offline 可覆蓋 greeting lock**（TASK-111 原始測試未覆蓋 lock 期間的 error/offline）

## TASK-113 — Sticky Chat Composer / Better Chat Scroll UX（DONE）

### 問題

1. Input bar 在 HTML 中位於 memory / audit / provider settings 之後 — 使用者需捲動才能輸入
2. AI 回覆每次強制捲到底部，中斷閱讀歷史記錄的體驗
3. 不適合 desktop-pet + chat 的使用情境

### 實作內容

**`index.html`**
- 將 `<div id="memory-toggle-bar">` 和 `<footer id="input-bar">` 移至 `<main id="chat-area">` 之後，settings sections 之前
- Settings sections（memory / audit / provider）現在位於 chat + input 區塊之下（below the fold）

**`styles.css`**
- `body`：`padding-bottom: 14px` → `padding-bottom: 0`
- `#input-bar`：加入 `position: sticky; bottom: 0; z-index: 10`
- `@media (max-width: 700px)` body：移除 `padding-bottom: 10px`

**`renderer.js`**
- 新增 `CHAT_NEAR_BOTTOM_THRESHOLD_PX = 80` 常數
- 新增三個 scroll 輔助函式：`isChatNearBottom()`、`scrollChatToBottom()`、`maybeScrollChatToBottom()`
- `appendMessage(role, text)` → `appendMessage(role, text, { autoScroll = false } = {})`：移除無條件捲動，改由 caller 控制
- `sendMessage()`：
  - user 訊息、loading 訊息：`{ autoScroll: true }` — 永遠捲到底
  - pet 回覆：`maybeScrollChatToBottom()` — 只在 user 接近底部時才捲
  - error 訊息：`maybeScrollChatToBottom()`
- 同步修正：`testLoadingColdStartStatusIsVisible` 的根本原因（`currentProviderSettings = {}` 在 startup 時）已由既有 startup IIFE 中的 `loadProviderSettings()` 解決；
  TASK-113 patch 從 git clean version 重新套用，確保 IIFE 完整保留

**`renderer-chat-smoke.js`**（FakeElement 更新 + 5 個新測試）
- `FakeElement`：新增 `this.clientHeight = 0`；`appendChild` 改為 `Math.max(scrollHeight, children.length)`
- `testChatComposerExistsAndIsNotRemovedByMessageAppend`：input bar 在訊息追加後仍存在
- `testUserSendScrollsChatToBottom`：user send 時強制捲到底
- `testAiReplyDoesNotScrollWhenUserScrolledUp`：user 捲上去時 AI 回覆不干擾位置
- `testAiReplyScrollsWhenUserIsNearBottom`：user 在底部時 AI 回覆自動捲動
- `testScrollHelpersExistInSandbox`：三個 scroll 輔助函式存在於 sandbox

### 安全限制（均未違反）

- 不自動呼叫 `/chat` ✗
- 不新增 backend route ✗
- 不修改 `/chat` schema ✗
- 不修改 provider settings / Ollama routing ✗
- 不修改 persona prompt ✗
- 不新增外部 API ✗

### 驗收條件

- `node --check renderer.js` PASS ✓
- `node scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js` PASS（56 個測試，含 5 個新 TASK-113 測試）✓
- safety scan CLEAN ✓
- `python -m pytest` 586 passed ✓
- trailing whitespace CLEAN ✓

### 完成記錄

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`：input bar 移至 chat area 之後
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css`：input bar sticky bottom
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`：scroll helpers + autoScroll appendMessage
- `apps/desktop/scripts/renderer-chat-smoke.js`：FakeElement clientHeight + 5 新測試
- 全部驗收通過：syntax PASS、smoke 56/56 PASS、safety CLEAN、pytest 586 passed

**下一步**：可 commit TASK-113；繼續規劃 Phase 6 或下一個 UX 改善任務。

## TASK-114 - Pet Mode UI Design

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

### Goal

Plan the product and technical design for a future Pet Mode without changing runtime behavior.

### Scope

- Add `docs/PET_MODE_UI_DESIGN.md`.
- Define Full App Mode, Pet Mode, and optional Bubble Chat Mode.
- Draft Pet Mode window behavior: small transparent/frameless/always-on-top desktop pet, draggable, right-click menu, future position persistence.
- Define click, double-click, drag, bubble chat, mode switch, startup, idle, and return-from-away interactions.
- Define Electron architecture direction for future work.
- Preserve existing `/chat` schema and local-backend-only boundary.
- Update `docs/TASKS.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Do not modify product code.

### Design Summary

- Full App Mode remains the complete management, chat, memory, audit, provider settings, and debug surface.
- Pet Mode becomes a compact desktop companion surface for Christina.
- Bubble Chat Mode should be implemented inside the Pet Window first to avoid extra window-management complexity.
- Pet Mode should use a separate renderer in later implementation tasks instead of reusing the full management UI.
- Pet Mode should reuse existing Christina expression assets and call only the local backend `/chat`.

### Safety Boundaries

- No automatic file, Email, Calendar, screen, microphone, command, or external API access.
- No autonomous LLM call for startup, idle, or return-from-away.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No direct renderer-to-Ollama call.
- No API key exposure to renderer code.
- Pet Mode calls only the local backend.

### Verification

- Documentation-only change.
- No backend code modified.
- No Electron runtime code modified.
- No renderer files added.
- No external API added.
- No images added.

### Next Tasks

- TASK-115 - Create Pet Window Design Skeleton
- TASK-116 - Pet Mode BrowserWindow Prototype
- TASK-117 - Pet Mode Drag Behavior
- TASK-118 - Pet Bubble Chat Design
- TASK-119 - Mode Switch Full App <-> Pet Mode
- TASK-120 - Pet Mode Smoke Tests

## TASK-116 - Pet Mode BrowserWindow Prototype

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Add an explicit Pet Window prototype behind a safe manual/dev entry point.

Scope:

- Add future `createPetWindow()` in Electron main process.
- Evaluate `frame: false`, `transparent: true`, `alwaysOnTop: true`, and fixed compact size.
- Keep Full App Mode available.
- Keep `nodeIntegration: false` and `contextIsolation: true`.
- Do not add click-through yet.

Changes:

- Added `PET_MODE_ENABLED` env flag in `apps/desktop/src/main.js`.
- Added `petWindow` variable.
- Added `createPetWindow()`.
- Pet Window loads `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html`.
- Pet Window size is `220 x 280`.
- Pet Window uses `frame: false`, `transparent: true`, `alwaysOnTop: true`, `resizable: false`, and `show: false`.
- Pet Window shows after `ready-to-show`.
- Added `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`.
- Updated `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` so it remains focused on static Pet renderer skeleton checks.

Runtime behavior:

- Pet Window is disabled by default.
- To open the prototype, start Electron with `PET_MODE_ENABLED=true`.
- Full App still opens normally.
- No drag behavior, context menu behavior, bubble chat behavior, or mode switch behavior is implemented yet.

Safety boundaries:

- `nodeIntegration: false`.
- `contextIsolation: true`.
- `sandbox: true` for Pet Window.
- No preload API was added.
- No backend call was added.
- No `/chat` call was added.
- No `/chat` schema change.

## TASK-117 - Pet Mode Drag Behavior

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Make Pet Mode movable and prepare position persistence.

Scope:

- Add CSS drag region.
- Mark chat controls and buttons as no-drag.
- Verify drag behavior on Windows.
- Design or implement last-position persistence with display bounds clamping.

Changes:

- Added explicit `.pet-drag-region` class to `#pet-drag-region` in `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html`.
- Added explicit `.pet-no-drag` class to bubble, chat form, input, buttons, context-menu hook, and Full App hook.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.css` so the pet stage / drag region uses `-webkit-app-region: drag`.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.css` so `.pet-no-drag`, bubble, form, action area, buttons, inputs, and textareas use `-webkit-app-region: no-drag`.
- Updated `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` to verify drag/no-drag CSS and DOM hooks.

Safety boundaries:

## TASK-118 - Pet Bubble Chat Design

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Add compact Bubble Chat behavior for Pet Mode.

Scope:

- Add collapsed, compact, and expanded bubble states.
- Add placeholder input and send button UI.
- Add local-only open/collapse/submit state handling.
- Keep backend `/chat` wiring deferred.
- Keep response schema `reply / mood / source`.
- Keep bubble/input/buttons as no-drag regions.

Changes:

- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html` with collapsed initial bubble markup, bubble message area, input placeholder, send button, open hook, and close/collapse control.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.css` with expanded bubble state, compact expanded layout, shrunken avatar state, bubble message styling, and input/send layout.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js` with `setBubbleState`, `expandBubble`, `collapseBubble`, `toggleBubble`, and local-only placeholder submit handling.
- Updated `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` to verify collapsed/expanded state transitions, click handlers, local submit behavior, no-drag hooks, and no backend/Ollama calls.

Runtime behavior:

- Initial state is collapsed.
- Clicking the pet drag region expands the bubble.
- Clicking the Chat hook expands the bubble.
- Clicking the close control collapses the bubble.
- Submitting the placeholder form prevents default behavior and updates only local bubble text.

Safety boundaries:

- No backend call was added.
- No `/chat` call was added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No IPC added.
- No preload API added.
- `apps/desktop/src/main.js` was not modified.

## TASK-119 - Mode Switch Full App <-> Pet Mode

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Add explicit switching between the full management app and Pet Mode.

Scope:

- Main process manages both windows.
- Pet Mode can open/focus Full App.
- Full App can stay open alongside Pet Mode.
- Keep Pet-to-Full switch one-way for this task.
- Preserve Full App as the settings/memory/audit surface.

Changes:

- Added `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-preload.js`.
- Added narrow preload API: `window.dragonPet.openFullApp()`.
- Added fixed IPC channel `pet:open-full-app` in `apps/desktop/src/main.js`.
- Added `fullAppWindow` tracking in `apps/desktop/src/main.js`.
- Added `showFullAppWindow()` to create/show/restore/focus the Full App window.
- Added Pet Window preload wiring while keeping `nodeIntegration: false`, `contextIsolation: true`, and `sandbox: true`.
- Wired `#pet-open-full-app-hook` in `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`.
- Removed disabled state from the Full App hook button in `pet.html`.
- Updated `pet-renderer-smoke.js` and `pet-window-smoke.js`.

Runtime behavior:

- Pet Window still opens only when `PET_MODE_ENABLED=true`.
- Full App still opens by default.
- Clicking Full App in Pet Mode calls `window.dragonPet.openFullApp()` when available.
- If the preload API is unavailable, Pet Mode shows a local fallback message and does not throw.
- The IPC handler accepts no renderer-controlled behavior and only shows/restores/focuses Full App.

Safety boundaries:

- No arbitrary IPC exposed.
- No `ipcRenderer` object exposed to renderer.
- No shell, fs, process, or openExternal API exposed.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, file, Email, or Calendar access.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-preload.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 9 checks.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS, 8 checks.

## TASK-120 - Pet Mode Smoke Tests

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Add smoke tests and safety checks for Pet Mode.

Scope:

- Pet renderer smoke tests for state transitions.
- Safety scan for no direct Ollama URL and no external API.
- Verify `/chat` schema remains unchanged.
- Add visual/runtime smoke path when BrowserWindow prototype exists.

Checkpoint summary:

- Pet Mode track TASK-115 through TASK-120 is complete.
- No product feature was added in TASK-120; this is a smoke/checkpoint pass.
- Existing `pet-renderer-smoke.js` was strengthened to verify no external image URL in `pet.html`.
- Existing `pet-window-smoke.js` was strengthened so `pet-preload.js` is included in direct-Ollama safety scanning.

Main process invariants:

- Full App window logic still exists.
- Pet Window is still gated by `PET_MODE_ENABLED=true`.
- Pet Window loads `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html`.
- Pet Window remains `220 x 280`, `frame: false`, `transparent: true`, `alwaysOnTop: true`, `resizable: false`.
- Pet Window keeps `nodeIntegration: false`, `contextIsolation: true`, and `sandbox: true`.

Preload invariants:

- `pet-preload.js` exposes only `window.dragonPet.openFullApp()`.
- Fixed IPC channel remains `pet:open-full-app`.
- No arbitrary `ipcRenderer` exposure.
- No fs, shell, process, sendSync, arbitrary channel send, or openExternal API.

Pet renderer and CSS invariants:

- Bubble collapsed/expanded state transitions pass smoke tests.
- Full App hook uses the narrow preload API when available.
- Missing preload API falls back to a local hint and does not crash.
- Placeholder send is local-only.
- No backend call, `/chat` call, `fetch(`, direct Ollama URL, or bare `11434`.
- Drag and no-drag DOM/CSS hooks remain present.
- Existing Christina expression asset path is used.
- No external image URL was added.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-preload.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 9 checks.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS, 8 checks.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: PASS, 586 passed.
- Safety scan for direct Ollama access in `main.js`, `renderer.js`, `pet-renderer.js`, and `pet-preload.js`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

Next Task:

Pet Mode MVP checkpoint complete. Future work can start a new task for real Pet Bubble Chat `/chat` wiring, position persistence, tray/menu behavior, or manual runtime visual smoke.

Manual Windows visual smoke results:

- Pet small window can be dragged: PASS.
- Chat can expand/collapse the bubble: PASS.
- Full App hook can bring the main window back to foreground: PASS.
- Menu hook cannot be clicked / used yet: NOTE. It remains a placeholder; menu behavior is not implemented.
- After backend startup, Full App provider/backend status is normal: PASS.
- Pet small window stays always-on-top: PASS.

Safety boundaries:

- No code modified.
- No backend call or `/chat` wiring added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No external API added.
- No file, Email, Calendar, screenshot, microphone, or screen-monitoring behavior added.

Conclusion:

Pet Mode manual Windows smoke is PASS WITH NOTE. The only note is expected: the Menu hook is still a placeholder and should be handled in a future tray/right-click/menu task.

## TASK-122 - Pet Window Position Persistence

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Persist the Pet Window position locally so the next `PET_MODE_ENABLED=true` launch restores the user's last Pet Window location.

Scope:

- Save Pet Window position in Electron main process.
- Load saved Pet Window position during Pet Window creation.
- Use a local-only storage path outside the repo.
- Add an off-screen guard for display changes.
- Keep Pet Window size fixed at `220 x 280`.
- Do not modify backend, `/chat`, provider settings, Ollama routing, renderer chat behavior, or menu behavior.

Changes:

- Updated `apps/desktop/src/main.js`.
- Added `PET_WINDOW_WIDTH`, `PET_WINDOW_HEIGHT`, `PET_WINDOW_STATE_FILE`, edge margin, and save debounce constants.
- Added `getPetWindowStatePath()` using `app.getPath("userData")`.
- Added `getDefaultPetWindowBounds()`.
- Added `isPetWindowBoundsVisible(bounds)` using `screen.getAllDisplays()`.
- Added `loadPetWindowBounds()`.
- Added `savePetWindowBounds(win = petWindow)`.
- Added `schedulePetWindowBoundsSave()`.
- Pet Window now uses loaded `x/y` bounds when created.
- Pet Window saves bounds on `move` with debounce.
- Pet Window saves bounds on `close`.
- Updated `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js` to cover persistence and off-screen guard invariants.

Storage:

- Pet Window state is stored in Electron `userData` as `pet-window-state.json`.
- Stored data is local-only and outside the git repo.
- Current persisted fields are `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`; size remains fixed to `220 x 280`.

Off-screen guard:

- Saved bounds are accepted only if the Pet Window center point is inside a current display work area.
- If the saved position is missing, invalid, or no longer visible after display changes, Pet Window falls back to a default bottom-right position on the primary display work area.

Safety boundaries:

- Full App Window position is not persisted or modified.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, Email, Calendar, image, menu, or bubble backend wiring added.
- The only file read/write is the local app-owned Pet Window state file under Electron `userData`.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-preload.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS, 9 checks.

## TASK-124 - Manual Windows Pet Menu Smoke

**Status:** DONE - PASS WITH NOTE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Record the user-run manual Windows Pet Menu smoke after TASK-123.

Scope:

- Record manual Windows runtime observations.
- Update tracking documents only.
- Do not modify code.
- Do not implement a fix.
- Do not modify Electron `main.js`, Pet renderer, backend, provider settings, Ollama routing, or `/chat` schema.

Manual Windows Pet Menu smoke results:

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Click Menu hook | PASS | Menu opens. |
| Right-click Pet Window | PASS WITH NOTE | Lower / non-drag area opens the menu; top avatar/image drag region does not respond to right-click. |
| Close Menu | PASS | Menu collapses. |
| Open Full App | PASS | Full App is brought back to foreground. |
| Reset Pet Position | PASS | Pet Window returns to the safe default position. |
| Hide Pet Window | PASS | Pet Window hides; Full App remains open. |
| Relaunch with `PET_MODE_ENABLED=true` | PASS | Saved position is restored. |
| Bubble Chat | PASS | Still local placeholder; not wired to `/chat`. |

Right-click note:

- Right-click menu currently works only on non-drag / lower area.
- Top avatar/image drag region does not receive right-click.
- Likely cause: `-webkit-app-region: drag` consumes renderer `contextmenu` events in the upper drag region.
- Follow-up recommended: TASK-125 - Fix Pet right-click menu hit area.

Safety boundaries:

- No code modified.
- No backend call or `/chat` wiring added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No external API added.
- No file, Email, Calendar, screenshot, microphone, or screen-monitoring behavior added.

---

## TASK-123 - Pet Mode Menu / Right-click Menu

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Implement the minimal safe Pet Mode menu so the visible Menu hook works and right-click can open the menu.

Scope:

- Add local DOM popup menu in Pet Mode.
- Support opening the menu from the Menu hook.
- Support opening the menu from right-click on the Pet Window root.
- Support closing the menu.
- Add fixed narrow preload/main-process actions for Reset Pet Position and Hide Pet Window.
- Do not connect Bubble Chat to `/chat`.
- Do not call backend or add backend routes.
- Do not expose arbitrary IPC, fs, shell, process, or external APIs.

Changes:

- Updated `apps/desktop/src/main.js`.
- Added fixed IPC channel `pet:reset-position`.
- Added fixed IPC channel `pet:hide-window`.
- Added `resetPetWindowPosition()` in main process; it resets Pet Window to the safe default bounds and saves that local state.
- Added `hidePetWindow()` in main process; it saves current Pet Window bounds and hides only the Pet Window.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-preload.js`.
- Added `window.dragonPet.resetPetPosition()`.
- Added `window.dragonPet.hidePetWindow()`.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html`.
- Enabled the Menu hook and added DOM menu items: Open Full App, Reset Pet Position, Hide Pet Window, Close Menu.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.css`.
- Added menu popup styling and no-drag coverage for menu/menu items.
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`.
- Added local menu open/close state.
- Added right-click `contextmenu` handler on Pet root.
- Wired menu actions to the narrow preload APIs with local fallback messages.
- Updated `pet-renderer-smoke.js` and `pet-window-smoke.js`.

Menu items:

- Open Full App.
- Reset Pet Position.
- Hide Pet Window.
- Close Menu.

Safety boundaries:

- No arbitrary IPC exposed.
- No renderer-controlled x/y or command argument accepted.
- No `ipcRenderer` object exposed.
- No fs, shell, process, or openExternal API exposed to renderer.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, Email, Calendar, image, or bubble backend wiring added.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-preload.js`: PASS.

## TASK-125 - Fix Pet Right-click Menu Hit Area

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Fix the Pet Window right-click menu hit area after TASK-124 found that the top avatar/image drag region did not receive renderer `contextmenu` events.

Root cause:

- The upper Pet avatar/image area is part of the Electron CSS drag region.
- Electron `-webkit-app-region: drag` can consume renderer mouse/context menu events.
- Keeping the entire top area draggable is useful for the desktop pet, so the fix should not turn the whole avatar surface into `no-drag`.

Implementation:

- Added a clear upper-right `#pet-menu-hotspot` button inside the Pet drag stage.
- Marked the hotspot as `pet-no-drag` so it can receive click and right-click events.
- Wired hotspot click and hotspot `contextmenu` to the existing local menu open state.
- Kept the existing lower Menu hook and root `contextmenu` behavior.
- Kept the main Pet stage as the primary drag region.

Draggable areas:

- `#pet-drag-region` remains the main draggable region.
- Avatar/image surrounding area remains draggable except for the explicit menu hotspot.

Right-click/menu areas:

- `#pet-menu-hotspot` supports click and right-click.
- Existing `#pet-context-menu-hook` supports click.
- Existing non-drag/lower area can still open the menu through the root `contextmenu` listener.
- Full-window right-click is still limited by Electron drag-region behavior; the supported target is now explicit and visible.

Safety boundaries:

- No IPC added.
- No preload API added.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, Email, Calendar, file access, image, or bubble backend wiring added.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 13 checks.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS, 9 checks.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: PASS, 586 passed.
- Direct Ollama URL safety scan for `main.js`, `renderer.js`, `pet-renderer.js`, and `pet-preload.js`: PASS, no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` match.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, no whitespace errors.

## TASK-137 - Pet Bubble Long Reply Handling

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Improve Pet Bubble long reply detection, constrained display, and Full App reading path while preserving the `220 x 280` Pet Window.

Changed files:

- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`
- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.css`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`
- `docs/TASKS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/PET_BUBBLE_CHAT_WIRING_DESIGN.md`

Long reply threshold:

- `PET_REPLY_LONG_THRESHOLD = 160`.
- Added `isLongReply(reply)`.
- `stateForChatSource(...)` now routes long non-mock, non-error replies through `isLongReply(...)`.
- `source=mock` still maps to `fallback_mock` before long reply handling.
- `source=llm_local_error` still maps to `llm_local_error` before long reply handling.

Long reply UI:

- Added shared `PET_LONG_REPLY_HINT`.
- `long_reply` message shows: `回覆較長，可開 Full App 查看完整內容。`
- Reply text renders in `#pet-bubble-response`.
- The bubble does not auto-open Full App and does not create a new window.
- Existing Full App button/hook remains the reading path for longer context.

Layout safety:

- Pet shell remains fixed at `220 x 280`.
- Pet shell now explicitly has `max-height: 280px` and `overflow: hidden`.
- Bubble response remains internally scrollable with `overflow-y: auto`.
- Long reply response area remains capped at `36px`.
- Response text uses `overflow-wrap: anywhere` and `white-space: pre-wrap`.
- Avatar remains visible in expanded mode.
- Input and Send remain available after `long_reply`.
- Explicit drag handle, no-drag hooks, and Full App hook remain intact.

Safety boundaries:

- Backend code was not modified.
- `/chat` schema was not modified.
- No backend route or API was added.
- No IPC or preload API was added.
- No direct Ollama access was added.
- No external API, file access, Email access, Calendar access, image, or provider settings behavior was added.

Validation:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js` - PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS, 28 checks.

Next recommendation:

- TASK-138 - Pet Bubble Chat Smoke Tests.
- TASK-138 should consolidate Pet Bubble success/error/long-reply smoke coverage and prepare for manual Windows validation.

## TASK-136 - Pet Bubble Mood/Expression Integration

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Unify Pet Bubble response mood, source state, local state, and Christina expression mapping without modifying backend code or `/chat` schema.

Changed files:

- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`
- `docs/TASKS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/PET_BUBBLE_CHAT_WIRING_DESIGN.md`

Expression helper design:

- Added explicit `PET_BUBBLE_STATE_EXPRESSIONS` mapping.
- Added `normalizePetMood(mood)`.
- Kept `setPetExpression(documentRef, mood)` as the single avatar update helper.
- Added `expressionForBubbleState(state, responseMood)`.
- Added `setPetExpressionForBubbleState(documentRef, state, options)`.
- `setBubbleState(...)` now routes bubble-state expression updates through `setPetExpressionForBubbleState(...)`.
- Unknown moods fall back to `neutral`.

Response mood mapping:

- Supported response moods map to existing Christina PNG assets:
  - `neutral` -> `christina_neutral.png`
  - `focused` -> `christina_focused.png`
  - `happy` -> `christina_happy.png`
  - `proud` -> `christina_proud.png`
  - `annoyed` -> `christina_annoyed.png`
  - `worried` -> `christina_worried.png`
  - `sleepy` -> `christina_sleepy.png`
- `success` uses response `mood`.
- Unknown response mood falls back to `neutral`.

Local state expression mapping:

- `collapsed` -> `neutral`
- `expanded` -> `neutral`
- `composing` -> `neutral`
- `empty_input` -> `annoyed`
- `pending` -> `focused`
- `success` -> response mood
- `backend_offline` -> `worried`
- `timeout` -> `sleepy`
- `llm_local_error` -> `worried`
- `fallback_mock` -> `proud`
- `long_reply` -> `focused`

Safety boundaries:

- No image asset was added.
- Backend code was not modified.
- `/chat` schema was not modified.
- No backend route or API was added.
- No direct Ollama access was added.
- No IPC or preload API was added.
- No provider settings, external API, file access, Email access, Calendar access, tray, package, autostart, screenshot, microphone, or screen-monitoring behavior was added.

Validation:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js` - PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS, 27 checks.

Next recommendation:

- TASK-137 - Pet Bubble Long Reply Handling.
- TASK-137 should refine scroll/read-more behavior for real long replies while keeping the `220 x 280` Pet Window stable.

---

## TASK-135 - Pet Bubble Loading/Error UX

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Improve Pet Bubble loading, timeout, error, and retry UX on top of the TASK-134 `/chat` client wiring.

Changed files:

- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`
- `docs/TASKS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/PET_BUBBLE_CHAT_WIRING_DESIGN.md`

Timeout / cold-start behavior:

- Added `PET_CHAT_TIMEOUT_MS = 100000`.
- Pet Bubble `/chat` fetch now uses a local timeout helper.
- Timeout maps to `timeout` state.
- Timeout copy explicitly explains that the local model may still be waking up.
- Timeout state suggests opening Full App to check status.
- Backend timeout behavior was not changed.

Retry UX:

- Empty input does not fetch and renders `empty_input`.
- Network failure, timeout, malformed response, and `source=llm_local_error` preserve the user's input for retry.
- Send button and input are restored after request completion.
- No separate Retry button was added; the existing Send button remains the retry path.

Pending UX:

- Pending state disables input and send.
- A `petChatPending` guard prevents duplicate `/chat` requests from repeated submit while pending.
- Request completion clears the pending guard in `finally`.

Error/source mapping:

- fetch/network failure -> `backend_offline`.
- timeout -> `timeout`.
- `source=llm_local_error` -> `llm_local_error`.
- malformed response or missing `reply` -> `llm_local_error` with safe generic copy.
- `source=mock` -> `fallback_mock`.
- Raw stack traces and raw diagnostics are not rendered into the Pet Bubble.

Safety boundaries:

- Backend code was not modified.
- `/chat` schema was not modified.
- No backend route or API was added.
- No direct Ollama access was added.
- No IPC or preload API was added.
- No file, Email, Calendar, external API, image, tray, package, autostart, provider settings, Ollama routing, screenshot, microphone, or screen-monitoring behavior was added.

Validation:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js` - PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS, 24 checks.

Next recommendation:

- TASK-136 - Pet Bubble Mood/Expression Integration.
- TASK-136 should refine expression/state behavior from real `mood` and error/offline states without adding new assets unless explicitly planned.

---

## TASK-134 - Pet Bubble `/chat` Client Wiring

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Wire Pet Bubble Chat to the existing local backend `/chat` endpoint using the existing Full App request/response contract.

Changed files:

- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html`
- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`
- `docs/TASKS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/PET_BUBBLE_CHAT_WIRING_DESIGN.md`

Backend contract:

- Pet Bubble uses the same backend base pattern as Full App: URL query param `backend`, fallback `http://localhost:8000`.
- Pet Bubble posts to `${backendUrl}/chat`.
- Request body follows the Full App chat contract:
  - `message`
  - `use_memory`
- Pet Mode has no memory toggle, so `use_memory` is fixed to `false`.
- Response parsing uses the existing `/chat` schema:
  - `reply`
  - `mood`
  - `source`

Send flow:

- Empty input renders `empty_input` and does not fetch.
- Non-empty submit renders `pending`, disables input/send, and posts to local backend `/chat`.
- Success renders backend `reply`, clears the input, updates source status, and updates expression from `mood`.
- Input clearing policy: clear after a successful response; preserve input on offline/error so the user can retry.

Source mapping:

- `source=llm_local` -> `success` or `long_reply`, status `local`.
- `source=mock` -> `fallback_mock`, status `mock fallback`.
- `source=llm_local_error` -> `llm_local_error`, status `local model error`.
- network failure -> `backend_offline`.
- timeout-specific handling remains deferred unless a later task adds a timeout helper.

Mood / expression mapping:

- Supported moods map to existing Christina PNG assets:
  - `neutral`
  - `focused`
  - `happy`
  - `proud`
  - `annoyed`
  - `worried`
  - `sleepy`
- Unknown mood falls back to `neutral`.
- Pending, backend offline, and local error currently fall back to `neutral`; no new images were added.

Long reply handling:

- Replies longer than the Pet threshold render `long_reply`.
- Existing internal scroll area keeps the `220 x 280` Pet Window from resizing.
- Long reply message tells the user they can open Full App for complete reading.

Safety boundaries:

- Backend code was not modified.
- `/chat` schema was not modified.
- No backend route or API was added.
- Pet renderer does not call Ollama directly.
- No `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` reference was added.
- No IPC or preload API was added.
- No provider settings, Ollama routing, external API, file access, Email access, Calendar access, image, tray, packaging, autostart, screenshot, microphone, or screen monitoring behavior was added.

Validation:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js` - PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS, 21 checks.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js` - PASS, 10 checks.

Next recommendation:

- TASK-135 - Pet Bubble Loading/Error UX.
- TASK-135 should refine timeout/cold-start/offline UX on top of the working `/chat` client without changing `/chat` schema.

---

## TASK-133 - Pet Bubble Chat Static State Refinement

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Prepare Pet Bubble Chat for later `/chat` wiring by refining static DOM hooks, CSS constraints, and local renderer state only.

Changed files:

- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.html`
- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet.css`
- `apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`
- `apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`
- `docs/TASKS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/PET_BUBBLE_CHAT_WIRING_DESIGN.md`

Bubble local states now represented:

- `collapsed`
- `expanded`
- `composing`
- `empty_input`
- `pending`
- `success`
- `backend_offline`
- `timeout`
- `llm_local_error`
- `fallback_mock`
- `long_reply`

Implementation summary:

- Added explicit bubble state hooks for status, message, response, placeholder, input, and send button.
- Added a local `BUBBLE_STATES` map and `setBubbleState(...)` renderer function.
- Kept all state rendering local; no backend request is made.
- Added local composing and submit handling:
  - Empty submit renders `empty_input`.
  - Non-empty submit renders a local `success` preview for TASK-134 preparation.
- Kept Menu, Full App hook, Reset Position, Hide Window, and explicit drag handle behavior intact.

Layout constraints:

- Pet shell remains fixed to the `220 x 280` design target.
- Expanded avatar size is reduced while bubble is open.
- Bubble response area has internal scroll behavior.
- Long reply state stays inside the bubble response area instead of resizing the Pet Window.
- Bubble, input, send button, Menu, action hooks, avatar, and response area remain `no-drag`.
- Explicit drag handle remains the only drag region.

Safety boundaries:

- Pet renderer does not call backend.
- Pet renderer does not call `/chat`.
- Pet renderer does not contain `fetch(`.
- Pet renderer does not contain direct Ollama `11434` references.
- No backend route, `/chat` schema, provider settings, Ollama routing, IPC, preload API, external API, file access, Email access, Calendar access, image, screenshot, microphone, or screen monitoring behavior was added.

Validation:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js` - PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js` - PASS, 15 checks.

Next recommendation:

- TASK-134 - Pet Bubble `/chat` Client Wiring.
- TASK-134 should add the smallest safe local backend client path, preserve `/chat` schema as `reply / mood / source`, and keep direct Ollama access blocked.

---

## TASK-132 - Pet Bubble Chat `/chat` Wiring Design

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Design how Pet Bubble Chat should safely connect to the existing backend `/chat` endpoint in a later implementation task, without changing runtime code or `/chat` schema.

Scope:

- Documentation update only.
- No runtime code changes.
- No backend route added.
- No `/chat` wiring added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No external API, image, provider settings, or Ollama routing change.

Design document:

- Added `docs/PET_BUBBLE_CHAT_WIRING_DESIGN.md`.

Recommended design:

- Pet Bubble Chat should call the existing local backend `/chat`.
- Pet Bubble Chat should keep the existing response schema: `reply`, `mood`, `source`.
- Pet Mode should remain a compact companion surface, not a duplicate of Full App.
- Full App remains the troubleshooting and full-reading path.

UI state design:

- `collapsed`
- `expanded`
- `composing`
- `empty_input`
- `pending`
- `success`
- `backend_offline`
- `timeout`
- `llm_local_error`
- `fallback_mock`
- `long_reply`

Loading / timeout / cold-start design:

- Disable input and Send while pending.
- Show a visible pending hint such as `吾正在想，別催。`.
- Do not make the window look stuck.
- On timeout or local provider failure, show a short local cold-start hint.
- Use Open Full App as the troubleshooting path.

Source / mood / expression design:

- Show compact source badges such as `local`, `mock`, `local error`, or `offline`.
- Use backend `mood` to update Christina expression after successful replies.
- Use pending/error/offline expression fallbacks where available.
- Unknown mood falls back to neutral.

Long reply design:

- Keep the Pet Window fixed at `220 x 280`.
- Use a constrained scrollable reply area.
- Do not resize the BrowserWindow for long replies.
- Offer Open Full App for more reading room.

Safety boundaries:

- Pet renderer does not directly call Ollama.
- Pet renderer calls only the local backend.
- Pet renderer does not read files, Email, or Calendar.
- Pet renderer does not execute commands.
- Pet renderer does not call external APIs.
- Pet Mode does not screenshot, record audio, or monitor the screen.
- Pet Mode does not modify provider settings.
- Pet Mode does not change `/chat` schema.
- Pet Mode does not add arbitrary IPC.
- Preload does not expose arbitrary `ipcRenderer`, fs, shell, or process.

Follow-up task breakdown:

- TASK-133 - Pet Bubble Chat Static State Refinement.
- TASK-134 - Pet Bubble `/chat` Client Wiring.
- TASK-135 - Pet Bubble Loading/Error UX.
- TASK-136 - Pet Bubble Mood/Expression Integration.
- TASK-137 - Pet Bubble Long Reply Handling.
- TASK-138 - Pet Bubble Chat Smoke Tests.
- TASK-139 - Manual Windows Pet Bubble Chat Smoke.

Scope:

- Documentation update only.
- No runtime code changes.
- No backend route added.
- No `/chat` wiring added.
- No `/chat` schema change.

Checkpoint document:

- Added `docs/PET_MODE_RELEASE_CHECKPOINT.md`.

- Christina avatar, local hint, and Bubble Chat placeholder.
- Explicit top drag handle.
- No-drag avatar, bubble, menu, buttons, inputs, and controls.
- Local bubble collapsed / expanded state.
- Pet -> Full App focus bridge.
- Full App -> Show Pet Window bridge.
- Hide Pet Window / Show Pet.
- Reset Position.
- Local position persistence with off-screen guard.
- Menu toggle, Close Menu, and Escape close.
- Manual Windows smoke PASS.

Deferred items:

- Bubble Chat is not wired to `/chat`.
- Pet Mode does not display real LLM responses yet.
- Pet bubble does not yet show source / mood / error / loading states from backend responses.
- Tray icon, packaging, autostart, and full custom drag implementation are deferred.
- Whole-character drag is deferred; large avatar/body CSS drag is intentionally not restored.

Safety boundaries:

- No automatic file, Email, Calendar, screen, microphone, command, or external API access.
- No screenshot, recording, or screen monitoring behavior.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- Pet renderer does not call Ollama directly.
- Pet renderer currently does not call backend `/chat`.
- IPC remains fixed and narrow.
- Preload APIs do not expose arbitrary `ipcRenderer`, fs, shell, or process.

Checkpoint results:

- `node --check` coverage for main, full renderer, full preload, pet renderer, pet preload, and smoke scripts: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 13 checks.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS, 10 checks.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: PASS, 586 passed.
- Direct Ollama `11434` safety scan: PASS.
- Manual Windows Pet drag/menu smoke: PASS.

Next recommendation:

- TASK-132 - Pet Bubble Chat `/chat` Wiring Design.
- TASK-132 should be design-only first and cover loading state, backend offline, `llm_local` / `mock` / error source display, mood to expression integration, long reply handling, timeout / cold-start hints, safe send flow, and no schema change unless explicitly planned.

## TASK-130 - Manual Windows Pet Drag/Menu Smoke

**Status:** DONE - PASS
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Record the user-run Windows manual smoke after TASK-127 through TASK-129 stabilized Pet Window drag/menu behavior and TASK-128 added Full App -> Show Pet Window.

Scope:

- Documentation update only.
- No runtime code changes.
- No `main.js`, Pet renderer, backend, provider settings, Ollama routing, or `/chat` schema changes.

Manual Windows smoke results:

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Top drag handle drags Pet Window | PASS | Enlarged handle is usable. |
| Avatar / image area no longer broadly opens Windows system menu | PASS | Large avatar/body drag region remains removed. |
| Bottom Menu opens on first click | PASS | Menu toggle open path works. |
| Bottom Menu closes on second click | PASS | Menu toggle close path works. |
| Escape closes Menu | PASS | Keyboard close path works. |
| Chat bubble expands/collapses | PASS | Bubble remains local placeholder UI. |
| Full App hook brings main window forward | PASS | Pet -> Full App bridge works. |
| Hide Pet Window hides the small window | PASS | Full App remains open. |
| Full App Show Pet brings Pet Window back | PASS | Full App -> Pet Window bridge works. |
| Reset Position returns to safe default | PASS | Position reset remains functional. |

Notes:

- No remaining manual smoke note for TASK-130.
- Windows drag-region limitation remains documented: only the explicit drag handle uses CSS-native drag; large avatar/body drag is intentionally not restored.
- Bubble Chat remains local placeholder UI and is not wired to `/chat`.

Safety boundaries:

- No code modified for TASK-130.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No IPC, preload API, external API, file access, Email access, Calendar access, image, or bubble backend wiring added.

## TASK-129 - Fix Pet Window Drag Regression

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Fix the Pet Window drag regression after TASK-127 replaced the large avatar/stage drag region with a small explicit drag handle.

Root cause:

- The explicit `#pet-drag-handle` existed and was the only CSS-native drag region.
- It was not marked `pet-no-drag`, and it had `-webkit-app-region: drag`.
- The practical problem was hit target size: the handle was only `58 x 10 px`, too small for reliable manual dragging on Windows.
- The handle was subtle enough that users could miss it and assume the Pet Window was not draggable.

Implementation:

- Kept the explicit drag handle approach.
- Enlarged `#pet-drag-handle` to a top bar: `156 x 24 px`.
- Raised handle stacking with `z-index: 8`.
- Added `pointer-events: auto` and `user-select: none`.
- Added a subtle visual grip line using CSS `::before`.
- Kept avatar, pet body, bubble, menu, buttons, input, and textarea as no-drag.
- Did not restore large-area avatar/body drag region.

UX rule:

- The top drag handle is the only draggable area.
- Avatar, bubble, and controls remain interaction-first no-drag areas.
- Windows drag-region right-click limitation remains accepted only for the explicit handle.
- Whole-character drag remains deferred to a future custom drag implementation.

Safety boundaries:

- No IPC added.
- No preload API added.
- No `main.js` change.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, Email, Calendar, file access, image, or bubble backend wiring added.

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 13 checks.

- `python -m pytest`: PASS, 586 passed.
- Direct Ollama URL safety scan: PASS, no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` match.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, no whitespace errors.

## TASK-128 - Full App -> Show Pet Window Bridge

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Allow the Full App to show/focus Pet Window again after the Pet menu `Hide Pet Window` action hides it.

Implementation:

- Added a Full App header button: `Show Pet`.
- Added a Full App local status label for Show Pet results.
- Added Full App preload `apps/desktop/src/renderer/preload.js`.
- Exposed only `window.dragonPet.showPetWindow()`.
- Added fixed IPC channel `pet:show-window`.
- Added `showPetWindow()` in main process:
  - if Pet Mode is disabled, returns `{ ok: false, reason: "pet_mode_disabled" }`;
  - if Pet Window exists, restores/shows/focuses it;
  - if Pet Window does not exist and `PET_MODE_ENABLED=true`, creates it and shows/focuses it.

Safety boundaries:

- Full App preload does not expose arbitrary `ipcRenderer`.
- Full App preload does not expose fs, shell, process, or arbitrary channel send.
- Renderer does not pass commands, coordinates, or arbitrary payloads.
- Full App Window is not hidden, closed, or repositioned.
- No backend route added.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No Ollama call added.
- Bubble Chat remains local placeholder UI only.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/main.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/src/renderer/preload.js`: PASS.

## TASK-127 - Replace Large Pet Drag Region with Explicit Drag Handle

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Reduce Windows OS system menu interference by removing the large Pet Mode CSS drag region and replacing it with a small explicit drag handle.

Root cause:

- On Windows, `-webkit-app-region: drag` behaves like a native title bar region.
- Right-clicking that region may show the Windows system menu instead of the Pet DOM menu.
- A large avatar/stage drag region makes normal Pet interactions overlap with native window behavior.

Implementation:

- Added `#pet-drag-handle` as a small top drag grip.
- Changed `#pet-drag-region` / avatar stage from a large drag region to a no-drag interaction region.
- Marked avatar container, avatar image, hint, bubble, menu, action hooks, buttons, inputs, and textareas as no-drag.
- Kept the bottom `Menu` button toggle behavior from TASK-126.
- Kept `Close Menu` and Escape-to-close behavior.
- Kept no-drag-area right-click as a local Pet menu toggle where renderer events are delivered.

UX rule:

- Only the small `#pet-drag-handle` uses CSS-native `-webkit-app-region: drag`.
- Avatar, bubble, and controls are interaction-first no-drag areas.
- Right-clicking the drag handle may still show the Windows OS system menu; that is acceptable because the handle is small and explicit.
- If a future task wants the whole character to be draggable without OS system menu interference, it should use a custom drag implementation instead of large-area CSS `app-region: drag`.

Safety boundaries:

- No IPC added.
- No preload API added.
- No `main.js` change.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, Email, Calendar, file access, image, or bubble backend wiring added.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 13 checks.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-window-smoke.js`: PASS, 9 checks.
- `npm.cmd run test:renderer`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest`: PASS, 586 passed.
- Direct Ollama URL safety scan for `main.js`, `renderer.js`, `pet-renderer.js`, and `pet-preload.js`: PASS, no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` match.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, no whitespace errors.

## TASK-126 - Fix Pet Menu UX Regression

**Status:** DONE
**Date:** 2026-05-24

Goal:

Fix the Pet Menu UX regression found after TASK-125 manual Windows testing.

Root cause:

- The visible upper-right `#pet-menu-hotspot` solved a hit-area problem but created a duplicated Menu affordance.
- On Windows, right-clicking Electron `-webkit-app-region: drag` behaves like right-clicking a title bar and may show the OS system menu.
- Renderer `contextmenu` is not reliable on drag-region pixels, so full-window custom right-click conflicts with native dragging.

Implementation:

- Removed the visible upper-right `#pet-menu-hotspot`.
- Removed hotspot CSS and renderer event wiring.
- Kept the bottom `Chat / Full App / Menu` action row.
- Changed the bottom `Menu` button to toggle the Pet DOM menu:
  - closed -> open
  - open -> closed
- Kept `Close Menu` behavior.
- Added Escape-to-close for the local DOM menu.
- Kept no-drag-area right-click as a local menu toggle where renderer events are delivered.

UX rule:

- Drag region is primarily for dragging.
- On Windows, right-clicking the drag region may trigger the OS system menu.
- Pet custom menu primary entry is the bottom `Menu` button.
- Full-window custom right-click is deferred unless a future task introduces custom drag behavior instead of CSS native drag.

Safety boundaries:

- No IPC added.
- No preload API added.
- No `main.js` change.
- No backend call added.
- No `/chat` call added.
- No `/chat` schema change.
- No provider settings or Ollama routing change.
- No external API, Email, Calendar, file access, image, or bubble backend wiring added.

Verification:

- `node --check apps/desktop/src/pet/pet-renderer.js`: PASS.
- `node --check apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS.
- `node apps/desktop/scripts/pet-renderer-smoke.js`: PASS, 13 checks.

- `python -m pytest`: PASS, 586 passed.
- Direct Ollama URL safety scan for `main.js`, `renderer.js`, `pet-renderer.js`, and `pet-preload.js`: PASS, no `localhost:11434`, `127.0.0.1:11434`, or bare `11434` match.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, no whitespace errors.
